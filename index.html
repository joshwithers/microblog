			 <p><a href="https://tracesmagazine.com.au/2012/12/author-qa-hobart-by-peter-timms/">Self-proclaimed</a> &ldquo;not a professional historian&rdquo; Peter Timms begins his 2009 book, <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7496905-in-search-of-hobart">In Search of Hobart</a></em> with the most captivating line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Too far south for spices,&quot; Abel Tasman wrote dismissively in 1642 on sighting the island now bearing his name, &ldquo;and too close to the rim of the earth to be inhabited by anything but freaks and monsters.&rdquo; Wrong on both counts, as it happened, he sailed on rather grandly into the Pacific looking for somewhere more worth discovering. No other European bothered to put in an appearance for almost a century and a half.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Too far south for spices, and too close to the rim of the earth to be inhabited by anything but freaks and monsters&rdquo; is a powerful line.</p>
<p>So while in Amsterdam I went searching for the journal so I could read the line in context because in all my research I couldn&rsquo;t find it online.</p>

<h2 id="23-november">23 November</h2>
<p>Good weather and the wind southwest with a continuous breeze. In the morning we noticed that our rudder was broken above in the hole of the rudder post. We held close to the wind with small sail and fastened a beam on both sides.</p>
<p>At midday we found the altitude of 42 degrees 50 minutes and longitude 160 degrees 51 minutes, course maintained east and sailed 25 miles. We had here one degree northwesterly variation which decreases very rapidly here. By our estimation we now have the western side of New Guinea to the north of us.</p>
<p><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/withers/map_huMWY71oN" alt="Map of where Abel Tasman thought he was ⌘"></p>
<h2 id="24-november">24 November</h2>
<p>Good weather and clear skies. At midday we found the latitude of 42 degrees 25 minutes and longitude 163 degrees 31 minutes, course maintained east by north and sailed 30 miles. The wind from the southwest and then south with a light topsail breeze. After midday, around four o&rsquo;clock, we saw land. We had it east by north of us, estimated at ten miles. It was very high land. Towards evening we saw in the east-southeast three more high mountains and in the northeast we also saw two mountains. That is less high than the land to the south. We had here a true compass. In the evening in the first glass after the watch was set, we put before the ship&rsquo;s council and the petty officers whether it would not be better to put out to sea from the shore, and asked if they considered that advisable. It was jointly decided to lay off from the shore after three glasses and go in that direction for ten glasses, then sail again towards the land, as appears more fully from today&rsquo;s resolution. Thus we sailed at night after three glasses with southeasterly wind away from the shore and had bottom at 100 fathoms: clean, white fine sand with small shells. Afterwards we sounded again, and found black coarse sand with pebbles. At night we had a southeasterly wind with light breeze.</p>
<h2 id="25-november">25 November</h2>
<p>In the morning calm, we let the white flag and the topgallant pennant fly from the stern, whereupon the ship&rsquo;s officers of the Zeehaen with their helmsmen came aboard us. We convened the broad council and thereby decided what can be seen in today&rsquo;s resolution, and is there extensively explained, to which we refer here. Towards midday we got the wind southeast and then south-southeast and south; then turned towards the shore.</p>
<p>In the evening around five o&rsquo;clock we came under the shore. Three miles off the shore we had coral bottom at 60 fathoms, one mile off the shore we had clean, fine white sand. This coast appeared to lie southeast and northwest, a smooth coast. We had the altitude of 42 degrees 30 minutes and as average longitude 163 degrees 50 minutes. We sailed away from the shore again, the wind ran south-southeast with topsail breeze.</p>
<p>When one comes from the west and has four degrees northwesterly variation, then one must look out well for land, because the variation decreases very rapidly here. Should it happen that one got a hard storm from the west, then one would have to heave to and not sail further. Here by the shore one has a true compass. We took the mean longitude, which we determined and averaged together, from which we find that this land lies at longitude 163 degrees 50 minutes.</p>
<p>This land is the first land that we found in the South Sea, and it is unknown to any European people. <strong>Therefore we have given this land the name of Anthony van Diemen&rsquo;s Land</strong>, in honour of the noble lord governor-general, our high authority who sent us out to make this discovery. The islands around it, as far as we could see them, we named after the noble gentlemen councillors of the Indies, as can be seen on the chart that was made of it.</p>
<h2 id="26-november">26 November</h2>
<p>We had the wind easterly with light breeze and foggy weather, so that we could see no land. We estimated to be about nine and a half miles off the shore.</p>
<p>Towards midday we let the topgallant pennant fly, whereupon the Zeehaen immediately sailed towards us, and we called to them that Mr Gilsemans should come aboard us, whereupon Gilsemans without delay betook himself to our ship. We told him what is reported in the note below, which he took to their ship to show to skipper Gerrit Jansz and give their helmsmen this order:</p>
<p><em>The officers of the fluyt ship Zeehaen shall describe in their daily registers this land, which we saw yesterday, at longitude 163 degrees 50 minutes, as our average bearing was, and take this longitude as a fixed point and from here recalculate the longitude anew. Whoever previously had the longitude of 160 degrees or more shall now make his calculation from this land; this is done to prevent all errors as much as possible. The command of the Zeehaen shall give the same order to the helmsmen and also comply with it, because we have found it so. The charts that are made of this land shall situate the land at the longitude mentioned above of 163 degrees 50 minutes.</em></p>
<p><em>Done on the ship Heemskerck, date as above, signed Abel Jansz Tasman.</em></p>
<p>At midday we estimated to be at south latitude 43 degrees 36 minutes and longitude 163 degrees 2 minutes, course maintained south-southwest and sailed eighteen miles. We had half a degree northwesterly variation. In the evening we got the wind northeast and set our course east-southeast.</p>
<h2 id="27-november">27 November</h2>
<p>In the morning we saw the coast again, our course was still east-southeast.</p>
<p>At midday we estimated to be at south latitude 44 degrees 4 minutes and longitude 164 degrees 2 minutes, course maintained southeast by east and sailed thirteen miles. It was thick, misty, foggy, rainy weather, the wind northeast and north-northeast with light breeze. At night after seven glasses in the first watch we lay the ship to with small sail. We dared not sail further because it was so dark.</p>
<h2 id="28-november">28 November</h2>
<p>In the morning still dark, misty, rainy weather. We made sail again and set our course due east and then northeast by north. Saw land northeast and north-northeast of us and sailed straight towards it. The coast lies here southeast by east and northwest by west. This coast bends here as far as I can see towards the east. At midday we had by estimation the altitude of 44 degrees 12 minutes and longitude 165 degrees 2 minutes. Course maintained east by south and sailed eleven miles. The wind came from the northwest with a light breeze. In the evening we came under the shore. Here lie under the shore some small islands of which one shows itself like a lion, which lies about three miles from the mainland. In the evening we got the wind east and hove to at night with small sail.</p>
<h2 id="29-november">29 November</h2>
<p>In the morning we were still by the cliff that shows itself like the head of a lion. We had the wind westerly with topsail breeze. We sailed along the shore which here lies east and west. Towards midday we passed two cliffs of which the westernmost shows itself like Pedra Branca by the coast of China.</p>
<p>The easternmost shows itself like a high blunt tower and lies about four miles from the great land. We sailed between the cliffs and the land.</p>
<p>At midday we estimated to be at altitude 43 degrees 53 minutes, longitude 166 degrees 3 minutes, course maintained east-northeast and sailed twelve miles. We sailed along the coast. In the evening around 5 o&rsquo;clock we came before a bay. It looked as if we would find a good roadstead there.</p>
<p>We decided with the ship&rsquo;s council to run in there, as appears from the resolution. When we were almost in the bay such a hard wind arose that we were forced to take in our sails and run to sea again with small sail, because it was impossible to anchor with such wind. In the evening we decided to put out to sea at night with small sail so as not to be driven ashore with that storm. This is all to be read more fully in the above-mentioned resolution, to which we refer here to avoid unnecessary elaborations.</p>
<h2 id="30-november">30 November</h2>
<p>In the morning at daybreak we turned the ship towards the shore. We had been driven so far from the shore by wind and current that we could barely see the land. We did our best to get closer to it again. At midday we found the altitude of 43 degrees 41 minutes, longitude 168 degrees 3 minutes, course maintained east by north and sailed twenty miles with storm and tempestuous weather. Here the compass points true. Shortly after midday we turned it about to the west with hard, unstable wind, and then turned it about to the north with small sail.</p>
<h2 id="1-december">1 December</h2>
<p>In the morning the weather was somewhat better. We set our topsails, the wind west-southwest with topsail breeze. We set course towards the shore. At midday we had the observed altitude of 43 degrees 10 minutes and longitude 167 degrees 55 minutes, course maintained north-northwest and sailed eight miles. It became calm. We let the white flag fly at midday whereupon the friends from the Zeehaen came aboard. We decided jointly to make for the land (as soon as wind and weather would permit it) the sooner the better, both to take note of the particulars of the land, and to see if any refreshment could be obtained, as today&rsquo;s resolution shows more fully. Afterwards we got a little wind from the east and ran towards the shore to see if we could find a good roadstead here. About an hour after sunset we dropped anchor in a good harbour at 22 fathoms white and grey fine sand, with gradually rising ground, for which we are grateful to almighty God.</p>
<h2 id="2-december">2 December</h2>
<p><strong>Early in the morning we sent pilot-major Frans Jacobsz with our boat with four musketeers and six rowers, each with a pike and cutlass at their side, together with the small boat of the Zeehaen and one of their petty officers and six musketeers to a cove that lay northwest barely a good mile from us, to see what useful things (fresh water, food, timber or otherwise) could be found there.</strong> 
Three hours before evening they returned, with various samples of vegetables (which they had seen growing abundantly), some not unlike a vegetable that grows at the Cape of Good Hope and is suitable for use as greens. Another vegetable was long and salty, and seems somewhat like sea parsley. The pilot-major and the petty officer of the Zeehaen reported the following:</p>
<p>That they had rowed well over a mile around the mentioned point, where they found high, flat land with vegetables (not planted but brought forth by God and nature), timber in abundance and a flowing water place and many empty valleys. That water is indeed good but rather difficult to get, and the stream runs so slowly that it can only be scooped with a bucket.</p>
<p><strong>That they heard the sound of people, also music - almost like a trumpet or a small gong - which was not far away, but they had seen no one.</strong></p>
<p>That they had seen two trees of about two to two and a half fathoms thick and 60 to 65 feet high under the branches, of which the trunk was worked with flint stones to be able to climb in them and empty bird nests. In the trunk were steps cut five feet apart, so they assume that there are very tall people here or that the inhabitants know how to climb those trees in some way. In one tree the carved stairway seemed so fresh and green, as if it had been carved out no four days ago.</p>
<p><strong>That the tracks they had seen somewhat resemble those of tiger claws.</strong> They also brought aboard some droppings of, it seemed, four-footed animals, and also some (at first sight) beautiful gum that drips from trees and has something of shellac about it.</p>
<p>That around the east point of this bay at high water a depth of thirteen to fourteen feet was found. At ebb tide the water falls there about three feet.</p>
<p>That they had seen ahead around the same point a multitude of gulls, wild ducks and geese, but not inland, although they did hear bird sounds. They found no fish, except for some mussels, which stick together in clusters in some places.</p>
<p>That the land is mostly covered with trees, which stand so far apart that one can walk everywhere and see far ahead, so that when landing one can always get sight of people or wild animals. The view is not obstructed by dense vegetation or undergrowth, which gives a good opportunity for reconnaissance when landing.</p>
<p>That they had seen in various places many trees that were burned above the foot to deep inside, with here and there a bottom of earth as a fireplace. The trees were burned as hard as stone by the fire-making.</p>
<p>Shortly before we got our vessels in sight, we saw thick smoke rising from time to time on land (which lay west by north of us). We therefore assumed that our people were making that as a signal, because they waited so long to return. We had indeed ordered them to return with haste, on the one hand to quickly learn their findings, on the other hand to be able to go examine another place if they found nothing useful, so that no time was lost uselessly. When our people came back aboard, we asked if they had been in that direction and made fire, to which they answered no, but that they had also seen smoke at various times and places in the forest. <strong>There must therefore without doubt be people here, who are probably of extraordinary height.</strong> We had today many variable winds from the east, but the greater part of the day there was a stiff continuous breeze from the southeast.</p>
<h2 id="3-december">3 December</h2>
<p>We went with merchant Gilsemans and our vessels as yesterday with musketeers and rowers with pikes and cutlasses to the southeast side of this bay, where we found water, but where the land was so low that the fresh water was broken by the surf of the sea and became salt. To dig wells this land was too rocky. Therefore we returned aboard again and called together the council of our two ships, with which we decided and approved, as today&rsquo;s resolution shows, to which we refer, to be able to stay brief here. After midday we went with the vessels, with pilot-major Frans Jacobsz, skipper Gerrit Jansz, merchant Isaac Gilsemans of the Zeehaen, junior merchant Abraham Coomans and our head carpenter Pieter Jacobsz to the southeast side of this bay.</p>
<p>We had with us a post with the company&rsquo;s mark carved in it, and the Prince&rsquo;s flag. <strong>We wanted to erect that post there so that it would be clear to later visitors that we had been here and had taken the land as possession and property.</strong> When we were halfway there, it began to blow hard and the sea began to run so hollow that the small boat of the Zeehaen, in which the pilot-major and Mr Gilsemans sat, had to return to the ship again. We continued with our boat. Close under the shore in a small bay, which extended southwest from the ships, the surf was so strong that we could not approach the land without danger of smashing the vessel. We let the mentioned carpenter alone with the post and the Prince&rsquo;s flag swim to land and remained lying on the wind with the boat. We had him erect the post with the flag on top approximately in the middle of the bay, by four high, easily recognisable trees that stand there in a half moon.</p>
<p>The post stands before the foremost tree. This tree is burned just above the foot and it is the highest of the four, but it seems lower because it stands in a hollow. It has at the top above its crown two high protruding dead branches that are set with small dead side branches and knots, so that it looks like the antlers of a stag. Next to it is a very green and round branch with leaves, whose side branches by their equal dimensions adorn the trunk and resemble the top of a larding needle. After the head carpenter had performed the aforesaid in sight of me, Abel Jansz Tasman, skipper Gerrit Jansz and junior merchant Abraham Coomans, we rowed the boat as close to the shore as we dared and the mentioned carpenter swam through the surf back to the boat and afterwards we rowed back aboard.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>We leave our successors and the inhabitants of this land - who did not show themselves, although we suspect they watched our doings closely - the mentioned post as a sign that we have been here.</strong> We did not search for vegetables because we could only reach the land by swimming, so it was impossible to get anything into the boat. This whole day the wind was mostly north. In the evening we took a bearing on the sun and found three degrees northeasterly variation. With the setting of the sun we got a hard north wind which rose hand over hand from the north-northwest to such a hard storm that we were forced to strike both yards and drop our stream anchor.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="4-december">4 December</h2>
<p>With the break of day the storm abated. The weather was better and with the wind off the shore from west by north we had the stream anchor wound up again. When the anchor was wound up and above water, we saw that both arms were broken off so far that we got nothing but the shank above. We also weighed the other anchor and then got under sail, to sail north inside along the northernmost islands and seek a better watering place. We lay at anchor here at south latitude 43 degrees and 176½ degrees longitude. Before midday the wind was westerly. At midday we had the observed altitude of 42 degrees 40 minutes, longitude 168 degrees, course maintained northeast and sailed eight miles. After midday the wind was northwest. We had this whole day very variable winds: in the evening west-northwest with hard wind, and west by north and west-northwest. We turned it to the north and saw in the evening a round mountain north-northwest of us at about eight miles distance.</p>
<p>Our course sharp to the wind northward. During the sailing out of this bay and also throughout the day we saw much smoke from fires rising along the coast. The trend of the coast and the adjacent islands we should describe here, but to be brief we leave it and refer to the chart that was made of it and is attached herewith.</p>
<h2 id="5-december">5 December</h2>
<p>In the morning the wind northwest by west, we held the same course. The high round mountain that we saw the previous day lay due west of us at six miles, from where the land bends away to the northwest, so that we can no longer sail along the coast here. Because the wind was almost contrary, we had the ship&rsquo;s council and the petty officers come together. We proposed - and so it was decided and afterwards called out to the authorities of the Zeehaen - to set the course due east according to the resolution of 11 November, and to sail on that course to the full longitude of 195 degrees or the Solomon Islands. This is all to be seen more fully in the resolution of that date. At midday we had the estimated latitude of 41 degrees 34 minutes, longitude 169 degrees, course maintained northeast by north and sailed 20 miles. We set our course due east, to make further discoveries, and also not to fall into the variable winds between the trade wind and the counter-trade wind. The wind northwest with continuous breeze. At night the wind west with stiff continuous breeze and good clear weather.</p>

<p>A car that pulled my attention, amongst an entire museum of cars that desperately screamed for my attention, was this Chinese manufactured car, the SH760A. The English sign reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The characteristics of old Mercedes-Benz sedans are very evident in this Chinese Shanghai. The lines of the roof and the doors were inspired by the Mercedes ‘Ponton’, a model of the 1950s. Yet this Chinese sedan was produced in the 1980s. The example on display came to the Louwman Museum straight from the factory in 1986 and is completely new. It shows zero mileage and the protective plastic still covers the upholstery.
The Shanghai automobile company was established in 1958 and lasted until 1991. The SH760 model, fitted with a straight-six engine also derived from an old Mercedes, was used in China primarily as a taxi or limousine for minor officials of the Communist Party. After this model, Shanghai started assembling various Volkswagen models, including the popular Shanghai Santana.</p>

			 <p>Monday&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/">WWDC 2025 keynote event</a> in California delivered plenty of excitement for tech enthusiasts, but it was a particular announcement about Apple Wallet that caught my attention as a frequent flyer. Apple is essentially &ldquo;Sherlocking&rdquo; one of the most - my most - beloved travel apps in the ecosystem, and I&rsquo;m not entirely sure how I feel about it.</p>
<p><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/withers/Apple_brings_flight_tracking_to_iOS_26_je60Z-WwB" alt="Apple brings flight tracking to iOS 26 ⌘"></p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with the term, &ldquo;Sherlocking&rdquo; refers to Apple incorporating features from third-party apps directly into iOS, often making those apps redundant. The term comes from when Apple killed the popular Watson app by integrating similar features into macOS Sherlock.</p>
<p>This time, the target is <a href="https://flighty.com">Flighty</a>, the <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/06/apple-announces-winners-of-the-2023-apple-design-awards/">award-winning</a> flight tracking iPhone, iPad, and macOS app that&rsquo;s become indispensable for many of us. I&rsquo;d give up my American Express before I gave up Flighty.</p>
<p><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/withers/Flighty_DLiUXKzcC" alt="Flighty screenshot from the apps website ⌘"></p>
<h2 id="whats-coming-in-ios-26">What&rsquo;s Coming in iOS 26</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/apple-elevates-the-iphone-experience-with-ios-26/">headline iOS feature</a> for travellers this year is flight tracking via Live Activities directly in Apple Wallet. Your boarding passes will now support real-time updates on your iPhone&rsquo;s lock screen, showing arrival times, gate changes, delays, and other crucial flight information without needing to unlock your phone or open a separate app.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/apple-services-deliver-powerful-features-and-intelligent-updates-to-users-this-fall/">Apple PR</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In Apple Wallet, a refreshed boarding pass experience delivers rich, relevant information straight to users’ fingertips with Live Activities that offer real-time updates about their flights. For added convenience, users can also share their flight’s Live Activities so friends and family can stay up to date on their journeys.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/withers/Flight_tracking_features_coming_to_iOS_26_WN2O4htQt" alt="Flight tracking coming to iOS 26 ⌘"></p>
<p>But Apple isn&rsquo;t stopping there. The updated Wallet app will display relevant contextual information below your boarding pass, including Apple Maps directions to the appropriate airport terminal, quick access to Find My for baggage tracking, and other travel-related shortcuts. Maps is also getting comprehensive airport navigation with information about gates, security checkpoints, shops, baggage claim areas, restaurants, and restrooms.</p>
<p>Sound familiar? These are features that Flighty has been perfecting for years, and the app even won an Apple Design Award for its excellence. The irony isn&rsquo;t lost on me.</p>
<p><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/withers/Apple_iOS_26_live_activites_VBzSQfRR4" alt="Live Activities Flight Tracking in iOS 26 ⌘"></p>
<h2 id="apple-wallet-is-becoming-more-powerful">Apple Wallet is becoming more powerful</h2>
<p>It was 2012 when Apple first introduced what we now know as Apple Wallet, that is getting these new flight tracking features in September. Originally called Passbook, it launched with iOS 6 as Apple&rsquo;s answer to digital tickets and passes. The concept was simple but revolutionary: store boarding passes, event tickets, loyalty cards, and coupons in one centralised location.</p>
<p>The app was renamed to Apple Wallet in 2015 with iOS 9, and its capabilities have steadily expanded. Today, it handles everything from boarding passes and concert tickets to credit cards for Apple Pay, student ID cards, and even car keys.</p>
<p>The newly announced iOS 26 software, which has been made available to developers this week, carries the new flight tracking features, but considering it is using the Wallet Kit framework, it would not be unlikely that this requires each airline to enable the features.</p>
<p>Australian frequent flyers will be familiar with how tardy our local airlines are with adopting modern operating system frameworks and technologies.</p>
<p>While we&rsquo;re on Apple Wallet, many don&rsquo;t know that it already includes a fantastic travel feature called <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/105123">Express Transit Mode</a> that can make your travel experience smoother. In <a href="https://www.apple.com/au/ios/feature-availability/#apple-wallet-transit">cities with compatible public transport systems</a> like Brisbane, Hong Kong, London, Los Angeles, New York City, Paris, Singapore, Sydney, and Washington DC, you can set up Express Transit to automatically pay for trains, buses, and trams without Face ID, Touch ID, or even waking your iPhone.</p>
<p>Simply tap your phone on the reader and go. It works brilliantly in cities like London, Hong Kong, and increasingly in Australian cities where contactless payments are supported.</p>
<h2 id="the-flighty-question">The Flighty Question</h2>
<p>Flighty has carved out a devoted following in the travel community by doing one thing exceptionally well: flight tracking. The app doesn&rsquo;t just show you flight status; it provides rich context, beautiful visualisations, and features like tracking friends&rsquo; flights, managing check-ins, and detailed flight history. It&rsquo;s become the gold standard for flight tracking apps.</p>
<p>The concern for Flighty isn&rsquo;t just about competition—it&rsquo;s about existential threat. When Apple integrates similar functionality directly into the operating system, third-party apps often struggle to justify their existence. Why download and pay for Flighty when iOS does the basics for free?</p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s hope for apps like Flighty. Apple&rsquo;s implementation, while convenient, will likely focus on core functionality rather than the rich feature set that makes dedicated apps special.</p>
<p>Flighty&rsquo;s social features, detailed analytics, flight predictions, incoming aircraft monitoring, airport delay awareness, and sophisticated notification system probably aren&rsquo;t going anywhere soon.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-means-for-frequent-flyers">What This Means for Frequent Flyers</h2>
<p>For us as travellers, these changes represent a win regardless of how the app ecosystem shakes out. Having flight information readily available on the lock screen eliminates friction from one of the most stressful parts of travel: staying informed about your flight status.</p>
<p><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/withers/Apple_Maps_in_Airport_6snweJfkh" alt="Apple Maps in Airport in iOS 26 ⌘"></p>
<p>The airport navigation features in Maps could be particularly valuable. Anyone who&rsquo;s wandered around Terminal 2 at Melbourne Airport looking for a decent coffee or frantically searching for the correct gate at Changi will appreciate having this information integrated into the Maps app they&rsquo;re already using.</p>
<p>The integration with Find My for baggage tracking is also clever. While AirTags in luggage have become common practice among frequent flyers, having a direct link from your boarding pass to the Find My app streamlines the process of checking on your bags.</p>
<p><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/withers/Airtags_in_ios_26_qytaN3lEZ" alt="Airtags in iOS 26 ⌘"></p>
<p>This move reflects Apple&rsquo;s broader strategy of reducing friction in everyday digital interactions. By bringing more functionality into core iOS apps, Apple creates a more seamless experience for users while potentially reducing the number of third-party apps they need to manage.</p>
<p>From Apple&rsquo;s perspective, this makes perfect sense. The company has been working to make Wallet the central hub for digital credentials and transactions. Adding flight tracking elevates Wallet from a simple digital wallet to a comprehensive travel companion.</p>
<p>The timing is also noteworthy. As travel continues rebounding to pre-pandemic levels, Apple is positioning iOS as the operating system that understands and anticipates travellers&rsquo; needs. Live Activities for flights, enhanced airport maps, and integrated baggage tracking create a compelling travel experience that&rsquo;s hard to replicate on other platforms.</p>
<hr>
<p>The first iOS 26 developer beta is available now, with a public beta expected next month and the full release coming later this year in our spring. For frequent flyers, this represents an interesting inflection point where our beloved third-party apps may need to evolve or risk obsolescence.</p>
<p>Flighty and similar apps will need to double down on their unique value propositions—the features that Apple is unlikely to replicate. This might mean more social features, better analytics, integration with loyalty programmes, or enhanced prediction capabilities.</p>
<p>For those of us who&rsquo;ve relied on apps like Flighty, the transition period will be interesting to watch. Will the convenience of built-in flight tracking be enough to replace the rich feature sets we&rsquo;ve grown accustomed to? Or will there be enough differentiation for both to coexist?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s certain is that iOS 26 will make flight tracking more accessible to the mainstream traveller. Features that were once the domain of dedicated travel apps will now be available to every iPhone user by default. Whether that&rsquo;s a net positive for the travel app ecosystem remains to be seen, but for frequent flyers, it&rsquo;s another step toward a more seamless travel experience.</p>
<p>The real test will be in the execution. Apple has a mixed track record with travel features, sometimes nailing the basics while missing the nuanced needs of frequent travellers. If iOS 26&rsquo;s flight tracking captures even half of what makes Flighty special, it&rsquo;ll be a win for anyone who spends significant time in airports and well worth the $75 odd Australian dollars a year.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m due in Sydney in two hours, Flighty takes my anxiety away but software feature redundancy isn&rsquo;t always a bad thing, nor are freebie features included on your default operating system, especially when your flight is delayed and you need information fast.</p>

<p>“Have ABC or the <em>Courier-Mail</em> run it yet?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was the standing order when I worked the CMS at 4BC radio.</p>
<p>No matter how solid the tip or tweet, nothing went live until a “bigger” outlet blessed it first. The policy didn’t just throttle scoops; it taught an entire shift of producers to become professional copy-pasters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Become a source for news lots of people want, <strong>and can’t find anywhere else</strong>.”<br>
— <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wired-katie-drummond-trump-musk-subscribers-peter-kafka-podcast-interview">Katie Drummond, <em>Wired</em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Drummond’s line is a manifesto for a business model that most publishers have abandoned. Original digging is costly, slow, legally risky and—crucially—doesn’t scale with CPM ads. The result is churnalism: Google “DOGE agency” or “Siri delay” and you’ll find dozens of articles that quote one another, not the underlying documents.</p>
<h2 id="exhibit-a--john-grubers-apple-intelligence-mea-culpa">Exhibit A — John Gruber’s <em>Apple Intelligence</em> mea culpa</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“In the two decades I’ve been in this racket, <strong>I’ve never been angrier at myself for missing a story</strong> …”<br>
— John Gruber, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino"><em>Daring Fireball</em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every Apple Intelligence feature <strong>demoed</strong> at WWDC 2025 shipped; the ambitious, un-demoed “personalised Siri” suite didn’t. Gruber’s 6,000-word post—<em>“Something Is Rotten in the State of Cupertino”</em> (12 Mar 2025)—was a public flogging of his own blind spot. Why did the wider tech press whiff too? Because they were busy quoting one another’s ecstatic AI takes instead of checking developer seeds or asking engineers whether the code existed.</p>
<h2 id="exhibit-b--patrick-mcgees-apple-in-china">Exhibit B — Patrick McGee’s <em>Apple in China</em></h2>
<p>Financial Times veteran <strong>Patrick McGee</strong> handed in his manuscript in September 2024. Over the next eight months Apple’s China exposure collided with a fresh round of Trump tariffs, yet tech desks were glued to OpenAI press releases. When <em>Apple in China</em> finally dropped (13 May 2025), reviewers called it “prophetic”, but the reporting had been finished for almost a year. The scoop potential was there; the ad-driven incentive was not.</p>
<h2 id="exhibit-c--wireds-62000-subscriber-spike">Exhibit C — <em>Wired</em>’s 62,000-subscriber spike</h2>
<p>When Elon Musk took charge of the <strong>Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)</strong> in January, <em>Wired</em> went all-in—“several stories a day, seven days a week,” as Drummond puts it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“After a week, I looked around and said, <strong>‘Where is everyone else? Why aren’t other news organisations covering this?’</strong>” <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wired-katie-drummond-trump-musk-subscribers-peter-kafka-podcast-interview">Business Insider</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The vacuum was so obvious, <em>Wired</em> signed <strong>62,500 paying subscribers in two weeks</strong>. Readers literally paid to reward reporting nobody else bothered to do.</p>
<h2 id="why-this-keeps-happening">Why This Keeps Happening?</h2>
<p><strong>Cost pressure:</strong> Shrinking head-counts, wages not meeting inflation, senior staff not staying on the beat, freelance rates that don’t cover FOI fees | No budget for research or visits.</p>
<p><strong>Ad-first metrics:</strong> Speed beats depth; SEO beats shoe-leather. Hot takes out-rank deep stories.</p>
<p><strong>Litigation risk:</strong> Australia&rsquo;s defamation law / US SLAPP threats chill stories. Editors spike anything without a spare legal war-chest.</p>
<p><strong>Platform algorithms:</strong> Virality skews towards the same “shiny object” (right now: AI). Homogenised front pages.</p>
<p>I’m sure there’s other factors not even on my radar today including audience care-factor.</p>
<h2 id="the-fallout">The Fallout</h2>
<ul>
<li>Unsexy beats (local councils, supply chains) wither.</li>
<li>Corporations spin unchecked because no reporter wants to be the lone sceptic.</li>
<li>News &lsquo;breaks&rsquo; via Police social media or emergency service press release.</li>
<li>Audiences see identical copy across 12 sites and decide the press is “lazy”.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-we-fix-it-a-non-complete-list">How We Fix It (a non-complete list)</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Fund the digging.</strong> Subscriptions aren’t charity; they’re R&amp;D for democracy.</li>
<li><strong>Celebrate articles that wreck your priors.</strong> Surprise is the price of learning.</li>
<li><strong>Demand receipts.</strong> If a story leans entirely on “sources familiar”, ask for the paper trail, The Verge does this well.</li>
<li><strong>Back legal defence funds.</strong> Lawsuits stop more stories than lack of curiosity.</li>
<li><strong>Publish your changelog.</strong> Post the list: people spoken to, documents read, and known unknowns.</li>
</ol>

<p>They booked their entire Australia holiday based on ChatGPT planning their itinerary.</p>

			 <p>My only experiences with electric vehicles are in renting them, and I rent quite a few as I travel.</p>
<p>The out-of-home charging infrastructure is bad.</p>
<p>Three stories from today:</p>
<ol>
<li>I’m staying at my mother-in-law’s home in suburban Gold Coast and the nearest public charging infrastructure is a 15 minute drive away. It’s got two charging bays, each time I visit there’s a queue.</li>
<li>I had a long drive today and needed to charge in Brisbane before the drive. I get fee Chargefox charging with my Sixt rental but the best located charging station was at a BP. The app - BP Pulse - is yet another horrible corporate app that forgets logins, doesn’t work well, and the third BP app I have on my phone. The working charger didn’t work, and the second was pre-identified as not working. So once the “working charger” had not charged the charging cable was locked and would not come out of the car. The BYD Atto’s manual is electronic and requires the car have internet access. There are three methods to manually unlock, it took me to the third method.</li>
<li>Charging station locations on Apple Maps and Google Maps sucks. Tonight I wanted to charge at a certain charger and I started the journey in a no-service area so I used BYD in-built maps which don’t know about an exit that had changed so I missed the exit and almost ran out of battery because I couldn’t charge at the BP charger earlier. Further to that I&rsquo;m now charging at a charger in Brisbane city that&rsquo;s not on any mapping application but is in the Chargefox app, however in the app it&rsquo;s across the road and a few hundred metres away and apparently in a construction yard.</li>

<p>It&rsquo;s a weird time to be a travelling EV driver.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Over the past two years I have become really disillusioned with advertising and marketing agencies. I&rsquo;m in a weird, niche, very unique field, so it&rsquo;s possibly <em>my</em> fault, but on all the accounts I can recall the provider of the marketing, advertising, and SEO services has also let me down professionally.</p>
<p>A friend who is a professional SEO operator took payment for services then never replied to a message after then. Colleagues in the wedding industry took payment for marketing services, then stopped responding when I questioned the low effectiveness of the ads. Countless stories of poor performance. Thousands of dollars wasted on stupid strategies.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve taken it upon myself to stop paying people and to learn to do it myself and I&rsquo;ve spent the last year reading and studying SEO and GEO. SEO is optimisation for the search engines like Google, Bing, Kagi etc, and GEO is optimisation for the LLM AI products like ChatGPT and Claude.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been implementing these new skills and I&rsquo;m now in the stage of seeing results. Slowly but surely, which is the only true way to win in SEO and GEO, over the long game. Anyone promising a short game win is doing dodgy work that will no doubt come unstuck eventually.</p>
<hr>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually happy enough to share my strategy because it&rsquo;s not really my strategy, it&rsquo;s just me doing what the search engines, LLMs, and industry says to do. Apparently it&rsquo;s all out there in black and white ready for you and I to learn and read. We just mostly ignore it and then complain about the algorithm.</p>
<hr>
<p>It&rsquo;s a three pronged solution:</p>
<ol>
<li>Website speed and technicalities</li>
<li>Content on your website</li>
<li>Content on other websites aka backlinks.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3 id="website-speed">Website speed</h3>
<p>The easiest way to slice this is to enter your webpages in the <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev">PageSpeed Insights</a> tool and to get your pages to 100/100/100/100 on desktop and mobile. It&rsquo;s hard work.</p>
<p>I eventually gave up trying to get those scores on Squarespace and Wordpress websites and I learned static site generators. In particular, <a href="https://astro.build">Astro</a>.</p>
<p>This is just an incentives game. Slow websites cost the crawlers literal money because it takes longer to crawl each page. They don&rsquo;t like you if you cost them money, plus users don&rsquo;t like you either.</p>
<h3 id="content-on-your-own-website">Content on your own website</h3>
<p>It turns out that these algorithms don&rsquo;t know what we don&rsquo;t tell them. So we need to tell them what we&rsquo;re about, what we&rsquo;re good at, what we&rsquo;re experts and authorities at. In lots of words and photos. A lot of the time. All the time. For a long time.</p>
<p>This basically means blogging but also the whole website should really tell your story. In words.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gone to great lengths to talk about marriage law and the essentials on my <a href="https://marriageoffice.org">Hobart Marriage Office</a> website, about <a href="https://hobartcelebrant.au">Hobart wedding celebrancy on my Hobart wedding celebrant website</a>, eloping to Tasmania on my <a href="https://elopetotassie.com">Elope to Tassie</a> blog, and about weddings on my <a href="https://weddingmagazine.com.au">Wedding Magazine</a> blog.</p>
<h3 id="content-on-other-peoples-websites">Content on other people&rsquo;s websites</h3>
<p>This starts with social media and Reddit links and call outs, but goes on to people in the same areas of expertise linking to you, and I&rsquo;ve gone a little farther. I&rsquo;ve been finding websites that were abandoned by their former owners, and building out websites there like I have on <a href="https://celebrantforyou.net.au">celebrantforyou.net.au</a> or <a href="https://thetasmanians.com">The Tasmanians</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you have a good and fast website, that explains your whole deal, and others verify that, you can win online.</p>
<p>Feel free to steal this whole strategy, or, hire me to do it for you or to coach you along it. I&rsquo;m offering the coaching for $100 a month or $1000 a year (commit to a year because it takes that long to really win well), $450 a month or $4500 a year to do it for you if you are a small local business looking to win in one geography, or if you have a larger business we can talk about about something that would suit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still loving weddings and love doing them, but I looked at my schedule and I could afford to take on 5-10 clients for SEO and GEO, so get in touch if you&rsquo;d like the help.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I was selling my mate, James, on how much I love living in Tassie, discussing how Christmas in Tasmania is lovely weather-wise, but there&rsquo;s something slightly sad about missing out on Christmas lights because the sun doesn&rsquo;t set til 9:30pm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only thing I don&rsquo;t quite love about Christmas down here,&rdquo; I told him, &ldquo;is that the sun sets so late that Christmas lights and proper nighttime celebrations don&rsquo;t really work the same way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then it hit me – Christmas in July would actually make more sense in Tasmania than anywhere else in Australia.</p>
<p>Our winters are properly cold, our mountains get snow, and we can actually enjoy a good drink beside a fire without sweating through our ugly Christmas jumpers.</p>
<p>James looked at me with a glint in his eye and said, &ldquo;Why not call it Chrismania?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And just like that, Chrismania was born.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Think about it. All of the traditional Christmas iconography – the snow, the reindeer, the cosy fireplaces, and woolly jumpers – comes from the Northern Hemisphere winter.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in December, Australians are throwing another prawn on the barbie and hoping the pavlova doesn&rsquo;t melt before dessert.</p>
<p>But in July? That&rsquo;s when Tasmania truly shines in its winter glory.</p>
<p>Imagine it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crackling fires in Huon Valley pubs</li>
<li>Proper Christmas markets on Salamanca Place with hot chocolate and mulled wine that actually warms you up</li>

</ul>
<hr>
<p>But Chrismania wouldn’t just be about matching the season to the celebration. It can be about creating something uniquely Tasmanian. This might be something amazing, something to light up the Tasmanian off-season.</p>
<p>While the rest of Australia swelters through forced traditions in December, we can embrace our island&rsquo;s distinctive winter charm.</p>
<p>We could turn the July school holidays into a time when locals and visitors alike gather to celebrate community, feasting, and light in the darkness – the original spirit of winter festivals anyway.</p>
<p>I can imagine special winter concerts in historic venues, carols and church services, Christmas-themed dinners at our world-class restaurants, and winter markets showcasing Tassie&rsquo;s incredible artisans.</p>
<hr>
<p>I&rsquo;m not suggesting we abandon December Christmas – that&rsquo;s still family time and our traditional celebration. But Chrismania could be our special addition, our gift to ourselves during the quieter tourist season, a way to embrace our island&rsquo;s unique seasonal identity.</p>
<p>Though, alongside keeping December Christmas, I will note that December 25 is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_of_the_birth_of_Jesus">barely a chance for being Jesus&rsquo; actual birth</a> day. <a href="https://www.livescience.com/42976-when-was-jesus-born.html">Some</a> say it was possibly in June.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Researchers have speculated that the Roman Catholic Church chose Dec. 25 because it ties in with the winter solstice and Saturnalia, a festival dedicated to the Roman deity Saturn. The church could also co-opt this popular pagan festival, as well as the winter celebration of other pagan religions, by choosing this day to celebrate Jesus&rsquo; birthday, according to scholar Ignacio L. Götz in his book &ldquo;Jesus the Jew: Reality, Politics, and Myth-A Personal Encounter” (Christian Faith Publishing, 2019).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tasmania can be about ceremonies and gatherings that bring people together during our coldest and darkest months. Everyone says Tasmania shuts down over winter, but does it have to?</p>
<p>As someone who <a href="https://marriedbyjosh.com/">creates celebrations</a> for a living, I can see the potential for something truly magical here.</p>
<hr>
<p>So who&rsquo;s with me? Could Chrismania become the winter festival that Tasmania deserves? I reckon it&rsquo;s an idea worth exploring – a celebration that honours both our place in the world and the true spirit of the season.</p>
<p>I’m thinking the last week of the July School Holidays would be amazing.</p>
<p>And if nothing else, it&rsquo;s the perfect excuse to have two <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8mt9Ogzi_Y">Christmas pud</a>s a year. I call that a definite win.</p>
<hr>
<p>Want to get behind this? I see it being community-led, but I&rsquo;ll build a website for it and maybe list events that people are hosting.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to celebrate Chrismania let me know on email <a href="mailto:josh@chrismania.au">josh@chrismania.au</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chrismania.au">Instagram</a> or <a href="https://www.threads.net/@chrismania.au">Threads</a>.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I ticked over 15 years as a marriage celebrant this year and I&rsquo;ve realised I&rsquo;d grown complacent.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reminded of wisdom around complacency by a former employee of a formerly massive computer company whose lunch has been eaten by the current first and second biggest companies in the world by market cap. Former Intel CEO, chairman, and employee number three, Andy Grove, in his autobiography <em>Only the Paranoid Survive</em> wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Business success contains the seeds of its own destruction. Success breeds complacency. Complacency breeds failure. Only the paranoid survive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the curse of the small business operator.</p>
<p>In trying to find that sweet spot somewhere in the unexplored wasteland of business, that demilitarised zone between growth-at-all-costs and death, you also eventually become complacent.</p>
<hr>
<p>Mine snuck up on me while I was distracted transitioning from <em>Best And Most Awesome Year of Business Ever</em> to a living hell, around March 2020.</p>
<p>The wedding industry is made of two basic elements:</p>
<ol>
<li>gathering people together,</li>
<li>most if those people are not local.</li>
</ol>
<p>Gathering non-local people was quite frowned upon from March 2021.</p>
<hr>
<p>I then got so busy recovering that I didn&rsquo;t realise that I&rsquo;d neglected:</p>
<ul>
<li>simple website design decisions which negatively impacted my SEO, like page speed and accessibility,</li>
<li>creating helpful, useful, interesting, local blog content,</li>
<li>being open-minded about social media&rsquo;s maturation (which is to say I was quite closed-minded),</li>
<li>adapting our business as the market changed,</li>
<li>and updating my clients&rsquo; customer journey.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>How do I recover?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been learning how to do websites that aren&rsquo;t Squarespace, WordPress, or Wix again - I&rsquo;m a big static site generator/Jamstack/Astro boy now. I&rsquo;m paranoid about getting 100/100 on Google Pagespeed and correcting all website errors on Site Console, and in Moz.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m making a list, checking it twice. It&rsquo;s time to find out if I&rsquo;m naughty or nice.</p>

<p>2024 has been a wild year of travel. Here’s my 2024 travel stats as of when I get home on December 2:</p>
<p>For 53% of 2024 I have slept in a bed I do not call home. 172 nights away from home, 94 flights, 85 marriage ceremonies, 275 hours in the air, 47 visits to Hobart Airport, 37 rental cars, 27 hours lost to flight delays, 15 airports, seven countries, six airlines, six Australian states, three trains, two boats, one moped.</p>
<p>Qantas Platinum, Virgin Gold, Hotels.com Gold, and Accor Gold, Mitre 10 Silver. No I’m not joking about Mitre 10.</p>

			 <p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the disconnect between mainstream media, social media chatter, and reality in Perth&rsquo;s coffee scene.</p>
<p>When Starbucks opened their first WA store recently, both mainstream and social media were full of people insisting Perth would reject it in favour of local cafes.</p>
<p>Well, I just visited this morning&hellip; The reality? Over 100 people inside and a 40+ car drive-through queue. Before 9am on a Saturday.</p>
<p>Just a reminder that media opinions and online discussions don&rsquo;t always reflect what&rsquo;s actually happening on the ground. That Starbucks is absolutely thriving.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​</p>

<p>Staying in the good graces of wedding venues, wedding planners, the different algorithms and industry blogs and publications.</p>

We don’t trust each other as much because we don’t take the time to know each other.

<p>So earlier today I was takin the family around Joshua Tree National Park. I took my phone out and realised I had no service but that little satellite icon was there and that this might be my chance to try <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/120930#:~:text=Starting%20in%20iOS%2018%2C%20Messages,Tapbacks%20over%20iMessage%20and%20SMS.">Messages via satellite on my iPhone</a>, a new feature in iOS18 available on iPhones 14 and later.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So you tap &lsquo;Use Messages via Satellite&rsquo; after choosing Satellite from Control Centre list of modes you can enable and disable, the same list that wifi and bluetooth are on.</p>
<p>I neglected to time it but I&rsquo;d estimate and say it took two-ish minutes to find a satellite and connect, whilst encouraging me to move around, move left and/or right, and perhaps find an area with more open skies.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The app gives you notification that you&rsquo;re connected via satellite and you have four options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Messages</li>
<li>Find My</li>
<li>Roadside Assistance</li>
<li>Emergency SOS</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;d not used any of the satellite features previously available so I tapped in to have a look out of curiosity.</p>
<p>But the new one was Messages so I sent the obligatory text message to my friend, Scott, and we had a semblance of success.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And although the connectivity isn&rsquo;t good enough for photos, group chats, or even on-to-one chats in any large quantity, I feel confident that if I was out of range in a country supporting Messages via Satellite - currently only U.S. and Canada - that I could deliver emergency text messages, or if nothing else, ask someone to double check that I didn&rsquo;t leave the iron on.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m reading Kirsten Power&rsquo;s <a href="https://kirstenpowers.substack.com/p/the-way-we-live-in-the-united-states">Substack on how life in the USA is not normal</a>, whilst visiting the USA, and I can not only agree, but say that many parts of the thesis apply also to Australia in a uniquely Australian way.</p>
<p>Kirsten:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I began to notice a learned helplessness in the United States, where people don&rsquo;t revolt at the notion of a college education costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. I wondered why so many people treat it as completely normal that we have GoFundMe campaigns to help people pay for life-saving medical care that their health insurance won&rsquo;t cover.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I watched as people on social media claimed it was &ldquo;pro-labor&rdquo; to tip a person for ringing up your order at a food or coffee chain rather than demanding the multi-millionaire (or billionaire) owner of that company pay their employees a living wage (as is the norm in Europe, where tipping is not expected and the owners of the restaurants and stores are typically not among the uber-wealthy).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I realized there are other places in the world (not just Italy) where life isn&rsquo;t about conspicuous consumption and &ldquo;crushing&rdquo; and &ldquo;killing&rdquo; your life goals, where people aren&rsquo;t drowning in debt just to pay for basic life necessities. There are places where people have free time and where that free time is used to do things they love — not to start a side hustle.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I started to have a dawning awareness that we don&rsquo;t have to live this way.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Australia might have a semblance of public health care, and tipping was not the norm (how tf is tipping becoming normalized in Australia is beyond me), but Australian society automatically assumes that everyone wants to be in a race to the bottom where we&rsquo;re overloaded with debt and ambition whilst setting our children up for a life of therapy.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to live this way.</p>

			 <p>Lucy Schiller in the Columbia Journalism Review’s <em><a href="https://www.cjr.org/business_of_news/final-flight-airline-magazine-united-digital.php">The Final Flight of the Airline Magazine</a></em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The idea of the airline magazine reaching everyone possible. An in-flight magazine is “for you, it’s for your mother, and it’s for your daughter,” she said. “Everyone has to be able to read it. It crosses generations with its appeal. Most people are aware the audience is broad.” So: the opposite type of product, really, from the personalized digital content tooled and retooled by increasingly specific customer data. “It can’t be niche,” Carpenter continued. “It can’t make people feel separated from it. It’s not going to be political or religious. It’s going to be inspiring, positive. Airline magazines don’t write bad reviews. We don’t interview someone to make them feel dumb. It’s all about putting positivity out into the world.”</p>

<p>“By the time I met my wife, I was a changed man and a real doctor. And our love developed differently from any I had experienced before. Less like a crystal vase, more like a basketball, our relationship is made for bouncing — for the good and sometimes rough play that modern professional lives generate. We do have fights (oh, yes, we do), but they do not threaten our foundation. They deepen it.”</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/359/2024/d0961508f6.jpg" alt="Techcrunch screenshot"></p>
<p>As my friend Ori said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Nothing like PE to ruin something.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Private equity seriously is <a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/the-long-bloody-lineage-of-private-equitys-looting-798597a4fa30">ruining</a> so many beautiful things on the internet (see <a href="https://bendingspoons.com">Bending Spoons</a>) because founders and creators often struggle make a living online, they seek growth and revenue and find it hard, so they sell to PE because PE can make money online: gut the product, layoff staff, raise prices.</p>
<p>Welcome to capitalism, you and I with our little savings can&rsquo;t stand in the way of it, but in the light of Squarespace going to PE, I&rsquo;m reminded:</p>
<ol>
<li>Two of our business websites being on Squarespace</li>
<li>The other one being on Wordpress (but not WP Engine)</li>
<li>And finally, of my own personal philosophy to POSSE and build things yourself.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://kottke.org/24/10/0045453-posse-post-on-own-site">Jason Kottke shared</a> this a few days ago from <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/posse/">Molly White</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The short-term solution to these problems is a little-known acronym called POSSE. Short for Post (on) Own Site Syndicate Elsewhere, it’s not a protocol or even a piece of software, but rather a philosophy.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s never been a better time to build your own house on the internet—your own website and blog—and never have to worry about Squarespace, Meta, Google, or Apple anymore. You’ll no longer need to worry about being cancelled or banned. Prices going up, or products being gutted. You get to choose your destiny. Your home is your home.</p>
<p>How to?</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn HTML.</li>
<li>Learn Markdown.</li>
<li>Learn to host and build your own website and blog, your own home on the Internet.</li>
</ol>
<p>For HTML, check out the beautifully made <a href="https://htmlforpeople.com">HTML For People</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“HTML isn’t only for people working in the tech field. It’s for anybody, the way documents are for anybody. HTML is just another type of document. A very special one—the one the web is built on.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And for Markdown, it’s just plain boring text with a few additions. The best place to start IMHO is with the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">document that started it all in 2004</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Search online for other Markdown tutorials, there&rsquo;ll be millions, but just start learning to write and format in an open language, one that isn&rsquo;t owned by Microsoft (.docx) or others.</p>
<p>From there, start investigating building and hosting your own website, like the one you’re reading this on. Hosted on <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.Blog</a>, built using <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>, and <a href="https://tiny.micro.blog">Tiny Theme</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>In 20 years, you’ll be thankful that you started building your own house online today.</p>

			 <p>Dave Winer&rsquo;s <a href="http://secrets.scripting.com/whatIsPodcasting">2004 definition of podcasting</a> is what I think podcasting is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Think how a desktop aggregator works. You subscribe to a set of feeds, and then can easily view the new stuff from all of the feeds together, or each feed separately.
Podcasting works the same way, with one exception. Instead of reading the new content on a computer screen, you listen to the new content on an iPod or iPod-like device.
Think of your iPod as having a set of subscriptions that are checked regularly for updates. Today there are a limited number of programs available this way. The format used is RSS 2.0 with enclosures.
In the future, radio shows like All Things Considered and Rush Limbaugh will be available in this manner, and perhaps other syndication formats will support enclosures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I feel like mainstream culture imagines a podcast is a group of people sitting in a room with headphones on and it&rsquo;s watched via TikTok or Reels.</p>
<p>Which, I&rsquo;m not going to lie, is quite confronting for a nerd like me who really enjoys his traditional podcasting.</p>

			 <p>Our decision to homeschool our children is often a hot topic of conversation among friends and colleagues. There are the usual jokes, and many people bring up something about socialisation. Britt’s favourite response when asked why we homeschool is, &ldquo;Why do you send your kids to school?&rdquo; Honestly, I love her cheeky nature.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I wanted to distill my thoughts on the subject into a blog post so I could share it with people when they ask. So, why do we homeschool? Let’s start with why we’re not that keen on traditional schooling.</p>
<p>Very few of us speak about our schooling in Australia positively. From bullying to anxiety, peer pressure to abuse, the system has been rife with issues. If my house had such problems, you’d never visit, let alone drop your kids off five days a week, every week.</p>
<p>Then there’s the stress the schooling system puts on our household. From rushing out the door in the morning to rushing back for pick-up, and then from school to extracurricular activities – it’s all a whole lot of rushing, stress, and expense that we don’t need to sign up for.</p>
<p>For something most of us hated as children, and also bemoan as adults, it&rsquo;s kind of strange that we force our delicate and still-forming children into it.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’ve also been deeply influenced by <a href="https://seths.blog/?s=education">Seth Godin</a> and his views on <a href="https://seths.blog/?s=school">school</a>. Reading his &ldquo;<a href="https://seths.blog/2009/01/super-bowl-laziness/">What is school for?</a> in 2009 changed me. With insights like &ldquo;school pushes hard for wide, not deep&rdquo; and &ldquo;education is not the same thing as learning,&rdquo; Godin has changed my perspective on how the world works and what school is for. I don’t believe the schooling offered by local providers will take my kids where I want them to go, I don&rsquo;t believe that what I think school is for is what the education departments of Australia think school is for. I don&rsquo;t need a babysitter or a childcare worker, I want my girls to learn from the best educators and that can (and does) happen outside of school.</p>
<hr>
<p>I believe our society is in the depths of a parenting pandemic. We’ve outsourced parenting to the government instead of relying on our families, villages, and communities. We depend on underpaid teachers to raise our children, school principals to discipline and lead them, and government bodies to decide what they should learn and how much they should know.</p>
<p>We look to the government to tell our youth how long they should spend on social media or devices, then complain, “My kid spends too much time on their phone,” forgetting that we are the parents, we are in charge, and if the child isn’t listening or taking our lead, that’s still our problem.</p>
<p>I believe my home is my responsibility, so we’ll raise our kids, we’ll lead them, and we’ll teach them how to be awesome adults. Because when we brought them into the world, we didn’t have kids just to have kids; we had kids to bring spectacular adults into the future.</p>
<p>Our goal is that in 30 years, the world will be enamoured by the generosity, kindness, and intelligence of Luna, Goldie, and whoever else may come along.</p>
<p>We’re also those awkward people who actually like our kids and enjoy spending time with them. We want to do that more, so we’re building a life, a business, a home, and a family that allows us to spend as much time together as possible before they want to leave the nest and go and be adults. Someone smart once said we get eighteen summers with our kids. I’m trying to get eighteen winters, springs, and autumns too.</p>
<hr>
<p>My brother and I visited our grandmother last weekend, but she was too busy for us. Yet she complains we never visit. I have this vision in my head of my old age, decades from now. In my final days, I picture all our children, grandchildren, and perhaps even great-grandchildren being with us at home. That sixty years from now, we would all joyfully and willingly spend our days together, enjoying each other’s company and missing each other when apart. Reverse-engineering that vision requires hard work today.</p>
<p>If I want a strong family in sixty years, I need to build one now, and for me, that starts with homeschooling. As for you and your family, that’s your call – so make the best choice for yourselves.</p>
<hr>
<p>Our girls have always come along with us in business and travel. I think Luna’s first outing was to the post office. Both she and Goldie are Qantas Silver Frequent Flyers and they are better at airport security than you are. When we go to the shops or work around the house, they’re not just with us – they’re involved and helping. We aim to spend time in nature with them, learning, investigating, looking, and asking questions. Museums, animal parks, libraries, and exhibits are always on our to-do list. Plus, we spend time writing letters to our friends around the world, painting and making art, and reading about the world around us while also engaging with beautiful literature.</p>
<p>Don’t worry that our kids will miss out on academics or socialisation.</p>
<p>In a world moving towards artificial intelligence, robotics, and automation, our hope is that our kids will shine in humanity and real intelligence.</p>

			 <p>I’ve been pondering what an Apple response to the foldable phones from Pixel/Google and Samsung might look like, and <a href="https://spyglass.org/pixel-fold-versus-iphone/">M.G. Siegler’s piece on Spyglass about the Pixel Fold</a> cemented it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I can’t imagine Apple releasing a plastic screen iPhone and compromising on screen quality considering the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-62727710.amp">long term degradation of the folding screen</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Witnessing the iPhone become thinner each year, along with bezels and screen margins becoming smaller and smaller, I can imagine an Apple play on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23171638/microsoft-surface-duo-2-dual-screen-revisit-updates-price">Microsoft Duo 2</a>. A hinged device instead of a folding screen.</p>
<p>It just seems smarter for durability, service, repair, and the hallowed &ldquo;customer-sat&rdquo;.</p>

			 <p>I’ve owned the domain name - theapplenation.com - for about 15 years and here is its weird story.</p>
<p>In 2009 Facebook introduced business pages. Before this time businesses and non-human entities started profiles that people would add as “friends”. When I saw the feature launch I tapped “create a page” and typed option+shift+k on my Mac because I didn&rsquo;t have any other good ideas and I like the keyboard shortcut.</p>
<p>Overnight hundreds of thousands of people became fans of . 110,000 by January 2010, 160,000 by April. It was just a cool thing to see in the Facebook news feed: &ldquo;Josh likes .&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few weeks into it Apple legal got in touch and said no way was this cool, so we renamed it to “Fans of Apple”.
Then a dude from CBS in LA gets in touch about monetising it and going big on the interwebs. He -and I - thought this Apple company might go somewhere in the world and maybe it would be a good business opportunity to create a project for fans of the company.</p>
<p>He was big on buzzwords like UGC and ROI. He suggested I register a domain name for the new project and community and he was busy getting funding from rich people. I was on breakfast radio in Esperance, Western Australia, so I waited patiently and decided upon theapplenation.com for the new brand.</p>
<p>They stopped replying to emails and I’ve held onto the domain since then. I&rsquo;m tried a few times to start a blog or something on there but the truth is that I&rsquo;m just a fan of Apple, I&rsquo;m no Daring Fireball/Six Colours/MacWorld/MacStories/whatever.</p>
<hr>
<p>An earlier version of this blog post had a failed project launch on it that wasn&rsquo;t really that interesting. I deleted that part and left the good story part here instead.</p>

			 <p>The story-song by the Crash Test Dummies, &lsquo;Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm&rsquo;, played this morning and I decided to - for the first time in my life - examine the song&rsquo;s lyrics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s essentially the story of three children in not-ideal situations, but not neccesarily bad or negative situations. Not underwhelming or overwhelming. Just three kids in whelming situations.</p>
<p>The first is the story of a boy whose hair is bleached as a result of a car accident. The second a girl with birthmarks on her body. The song then turns on a bridge when it&rsquo;s revealed that their stories aren&rsquo;t as bad as the third who has simply &ldquo;always just gone&rdquo; to a pentecostal church.</p>
<p>In response Canadian singer Brad Roberts - with that iconic bass-baritone voice - sings &lsquo;Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Which I guess is his way of saying, &ldquo;cool story bro.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So now, from this day forward I intend to reply to all cool stories with an mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, and if anyone questions my reply I&rsquo;ll not acknowledge them with anything but an mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm if it feels appropriate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just being my best reply guy self.</p>

			 <p>I made the 4am alarm to catch the 2024 Swell Sculpture Festival before sunrise this morning and as always it was a treat.
Something that stood out to me, and I don&rsquo;t know if it was new this year, but much of the art was priced. Some of the sculptures were on the way to $100,000!
If you can create art and put a price on it, and earn that price, then you&rsquo;re doing a thousand times better than I who simply places his art on Unsplash and Pexels in lieu of doing the hard work of making art that people want, putting a price on it that represents value and effort, and putting it to market.
More power to the artists who can exchange their art for good money, society will be better off for it.
These are the pieces that captured me, one in particular was interesting, the &ldquo;Personal Space Elevator&rdquo;.</p>

			 <p>For the past week, a globally well-known person has been on the Gold Coast for a reason unrelated to their popular life as one of the world&rsquo;s foremost YouTubers and technology reviewers. Instead, they were here to represent the USA in the World Ultimate Championships, with their mixed team eventually walking away with gold medals in the finals.</p>
<p>But you’d never know Marques Brownlee was competing on the Gold Coast unless you followed MKBHD, because the closest the Ultimate Championships got to any kind of media coverage was in Newcastle, where a local Ultimate player had been chosen to compete. A global championship of a future Olympic sport – allegedly under consideration for Brisbane 2032 and LA 2028 – and the only way you&rsquo;d know about it is if you happened to walk past the Runaway Bay sports fields.</p>
<hr>
<p>The simple fact of the matter is that &ldquo;the media&rdquo; is not compelled or required to report on or tell the story of every little thing that happens in our community, even if it’s supported and sponsored by local and state governments or the national carrier.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’m reminded of when a law that I had a hand in creating passed. I expected there to be a news article about it that I could share with colleagues.</p>
<p>But either no reporter was in parliament at the time, or if they were, they deemed this change to how Australia operated not fit for print.</p>
<hr>
<p>There’s something interesting about the news that you might not have noticed yet: every night, the news bulletin is the same length. The newspaper is a similar number of pages each day. And more so with printed newspapers, where there need to be ads sold by the sales team before there are pages waiting for stories.</p>
<hr>
<p>People often complain that their organic reach on social media is lower than it used to be. Despite the conspiracies surrounding Instagram and reach, the main contributor to the drop in numbers is the increase in creators and content, while the number of hours in our day has stayed the same.</p>
<hr>
<p>There’s a lot of quality life happening outside of newspapers, magazines, blogs, algorithms, interest graphs, TV, or radio.</p>
<p>There are many great restaurants not on any list, and so many good cafes that don’t appear on Google when you search &ldquo;best café near me.&rdquo; Billions of valuable, valid, and important stories never get shared by the news.</p>
<p>A lot of life happens in the margins, and that’s where I’m trying to cast my eyes—towards the unseen and the unheard. Not only because there’s good there, but because the systems we live in, the societal scaffolding we’ve built, won’t go there.</p>
<p>I have friends in Gold Coast media whom I could have called to tell about MKBHD and the championships, but that story wouldn’t have reached the top of the editorial pile. Not enough interest, not enough clicks, not enough views to report on a story like that. He’s just a tech reviewer. It’s just frisbee.</p>
<p>The media isn’t evil or bad, but the laws of physics and capitalism means it can’t tell every story. That’s our job – yours and mine.</p>

			 <p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/359/2024/8f7951b507.jpg" alt="Deleting the Overcast iOS app from my iPhone"></p>
<p>I lost a friend in software today as I delete Overcast from my iPhone. A ten year relationship ended because life’s too short to use annoying apps.</p>
<hr>
<p>For software that I’ll often use a lot, on most days, the developer changed so many fundamental ways the app worked that it went from an app I loved dearly for a decade to the most annoying thing on my phone.</p>
<p>Enacting sleep mode, something I&rsquo;d do as I drearily fall asleep in a hotel room away from my family had been buried away.</p>
<p>Streaming, something I didn&rsquo;t realise I used that much, because really annoying. Streaming barely worked before the upgrade - if I was sent an Overcast episode listen link from a friend it would almost never play on first try - but then to lose the feature was really annoying.</p>
<p>It became an exercise in re-learning how to walk, but I&rsquo;d never had an accident, I was just subjected to an updated and poorer experience.</p>
<p>Plus iOS 18’s beta cycle hasn’t been kind to Overcast either, which is totally my cross to carry, but it’s still impacted the upgraded use experience.</p>
<p>So I had to decide whether the Overcast audio engine was worth staying for, and decided I could live without. (Tim Apple: please feel free to buy Overcast and integrate the audio engine into Apple Podcasts.)</p>
<p>So little did I know that Apple Podcasts has actually gotten a lot better recently.</p>
<p>The podcast transcription is a feature I really like, and anyone I share podcast links with and from uses Apple Podcasts so shareability of podcasts is so much easier as is clicking links from podcast websites.</p>
<p>Every podcast website has an Apple Podcasts link, none have an Overcast link.</p>
<hr>
<p>Before the Overcast update it was a fringe decision to be on a third party podcast app. After the update it was a liability.</p>
<p>Life&rsquo;s too short to be confusedly thumbing through podcast apps trying to figure it all out again.</p>
<hr>
<p>Why blog about it? Because I can’t review about it.</p>

			 <p>I’ve got a genuine interest inst in the new Pixel phones. Genuinely curiosity if they’d feel nice in hand, how the UI feels, how it works. Maybe they’re a real competitor to the iPhone.</p>
<p>But sampling the product is nigh impossible. They’re on display in shops but covered in security accessories that stop you from folding the folding phone or holding it in hand, plus this one in particular set the alarm off if it was picked up.</p>
<p>I wonder what the cost of loss of sales is compared to stock loss due to theft? Also, it sucks that we live in a world now where theft is so common.</p>

			 <p>Josh Nadeau, aka Instagram’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/swordandpencil">@swordandpencil</a>, shared these words in a story today and my boy <a href="https://micro.blog/qldnick">@qldnick</a> shared them with me, which is all to say I have intelligent and thoughtful friends and also that I can’t source the original quote. Regardless of those technicalities, I can’t stop thinking about.</p>
<p>Wendell Berry’s thoughts on technological progress:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But in general, apart from its own highly specialised standards of quantity and efficiency, “technological progress” has produced a social and ecological decline. Industrial war, except by the most fanatically narrow standards, is worse than war used to be. Industrial agriculture, except by the standards of quantity and mechanical efficiency, diminishes everything it affects.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Industrial workmanship is certainly worse than traditional workmanship, and is getting shoddier every day. After forty-odd years, the evidence is everywhere that television, far from proving a great tool of education, is a tool of stupefaction and disintegration. Industrial education has abandoned the old duty of passing on the cultural and intellectual inheritance in favor of baby-sitting and career preparation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>After several generations of “technological progress,” in fact, we have become a people who cannot think about anything important. How far down in the natural order do we have to go to find creatures who raise their young as indifferently as industrial humans now do? Even the English sparrows do not let loose into the streets young sparrows who have no notion of their identity or their adult responsibilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When else in history would you find “educated” people who know more about sports than about the history of their country, or uneducated people who do not know the stories of their families and communities?</p>
</blockquote>

			 <p>My 1994 Packard Bell 486SX 25/33 isn’t that impressive thirty years on but it impressed me in the 90s because it had a the set of matching SVGA monitor and video card. Super VGA my dude. 800x600 pixels, and 24 bit colour, that’s 16,777,216 possible colours per pixel.</p>
<p>I hypothesised back then that if you wrote a program that simply randomised the colour of each of the 480,000 pixels you could see any image ever - eventually.</p>
<p>I called it the Face of God idea. That eventually that computer could just imagine and display any image real or otherwise, even the face of God.</p>
<p>As the <a href="https://www.threads.net/@chriswelch/post/C-8LF4BOSAP/?xmt=AQGzSb6xl99tti8RSDwbazAXgFu-e-DryMeelAy7zNdNfQ">Pixel 9 AI “what is a photo” terror</a> arises this week I’m thinking about it all again. What does it mean when a photo isn’t a photo?</p>
<p>I wonder if this is the dawn of a new fantastic era of creativity and wonder, or if my favourite means of creativity - photography - has just been hit with a nuclear bomb?</p>

			 <p>Amazing on two notes.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Amazing technology to experience today in real life, not in a YouTube video or a TED Talk, especially considering the poor demo I received from the Apple Carindale kid who clearly had no interest in technology, the future, Apple, or immersive computing.</p>
<p>Secondly, amazing on where we’ll be a few years from now. If we’re here today, 2034 computing will be beyond our comprehension.</p>
<p>A notable missing piece is Apple’s native support for 360 photos. The VisionOS platform is out-of-the-box made for 360 photos, but they can’t be experienced on any Apple platform without third-party apps.</p>
<p>The setup I received was uncomfortable on my head at first, but some strap adjustment and getting used to it brought comfort eventually.</p>
<p>Apple Store staff in Carindale are not well-trained in the device, and there’s clearly an apathy around the unit that sits firmly at the feet of the high price, meaning that none are selling.</p>
<p>This is clearly the future. The Apple Vision Pro, but smaller, lighter, faster, better.</p>
<p>I also think that there’s a big opportunity to start capturing life—like weddings and children—in immersive photography and videography today, so that in 20 years, when we’re all wearing these, we can look back on our 2024 memories and see them immersively. It’s a remarkably different experience from current photography and videography.</p>

			 <p>If you talk to anyone in the destination wedding industry they have their bucket list of places they want to work. Mine is remarkably weirder than most.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been lucky enough to create marriage ceremonies all around the world in places like Iceland and Italy, New York and New Zealand, Croatia to Canberra, Fiji to Vancouver.</p>
<p>But my favourite places to travel are the weird places, more likely to be featured on Atlas Obscurer than Lonely Planet.</p>
<p>My destination wedding and elopement bucket list:</p>
<ol>
<li>North Korea because I want to fly Air Koryo and live to tell the story.</li>
<li>Saudia Arabia and Qatar because a Middle East desert elopement would be wild! Plus I&rsquo;d love to be the guy that delivers personalised and fun wedding ceremonies in the Middle East.</li>
<li>Tuvalu, Bora Bora, Tonga, Samoa, and The Cook Islands because I&rsquo;ve got big Pacific Island energy.</li>
<li>Bhutan where Gross National Happiness is a real thing they measure.</li>
<li>Kazakhstan because of Borat.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think it would also be cool to do a wedding in Llanfair­pwllgwyngyll­gogery­chwyrn­drobwll­llan­tysilio­gogo­goch in Wales because writing that name on a marriage certificate would be fun.</p>

			 <p>Visiting The Vatican inevitably evokes strong feelings. Regardless of your faith—Catholic, Christian, other, or none—the rich tapestry of history within Vatican City resonates deeply.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re like me, you might not have fully connected the dots between Jesus, Peter (from the Bible), The Vatican, Rome, the Roman Empire, and the politics intertwined among them until you walk through the Vatican Museums.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a definitive opinion on the matter today, and perhaps I never will. My opinions in July 2024 on Popes, Catholics, the Roman Empire, and The Vatican might not hold much significance.</p>
<p>However, I did take photos of the museums, the grounds, and the Sistine Chapel during my visit.</p>
<hr>
<p>A note on taking photos in the Sistine Chapel: the signage and staff inside the chapel ask visitors not to take photos, often emphatically reminding people with calls of &ldquo;no photos&rdquo;. My best understanding is that the restriction is due to copyright concerns, despite the artwork being over 500 years old.</p>
<p>So I disregarded the call because I don&rsquo;t respect it. Happy to receive feedback on why I should, but I don&rsquo;t believe it to be important today.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In the year 2024, we - the consumer/viewer/listener/single-digit-in-a-spreadsheet - have an opportunity to cultivate and curate our media diet, and I personally take that responsibility to be aware of the world I live in and contribute to really seriously.</p>
<p>I understand that I am the net average of those I spend time with, and that which I consume, so who I follow, mute, block, and subscribe to is of great importance to me. My impact and output on or to my family, community, and the planet can be ascribed to my intake.</p>
<p>Despite being featured in publications like the Daily Mail online or News Corporation newspapers, I generally choose to read or consume them on-demand, instead of having them flung into the different algorithmic newsfeeds I experience daily.</p>
<p>The news sources I do follow, like, subscribe to, get emails from, and even have notifications on for, are few and far between but they&rsquo;re really deliberate.</p>
<p>This brings me to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, one of the greatest protective bastions of Australian culture and identity. I get ABC News app notifications and follow them on Instagram.</p>
<p>The functions of the Corporation are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) To provide within Australia innovative and comprehensive broadcasting services of a high standard as part of the Australian broadcasting system consisting of national, commercial, and community sectors and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to provide:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(i) Broadcasting programs that contribute to a sense of national identity and inform and entertain, and reflect the cultural diversity of, the Australian community; and
(ii) Broadcasting programs of an educational nature;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Item (b) is about outside of Australia and although I&rsquo;m writing this in Rome, it doesn&rsquo;t apply to the article, and:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(c) To encourage and promote the musical, dramatic, and other performing arts in Australia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I now reference one of the great books written in recent times, <em>The News: A User&rsquo;s Manual</em> by Alain de Botton, on how news organisations tend towards engagement over boring important content:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the answer isn&rsquo;t just to intimidate people into consuming more &lsquo;serious&rsquo; news; it is to push so-called serious outlets into learning to present important information in ways that can properly engage audiences. It is too easy to claim that serious things must be, and can almost afford to be, a bit boring.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alain holds &ldquo;the news&rdquo; to a very high standard, and rightly so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For all the talk of education, modern societies neglect to examine by far the most influential means by which their populations are educated. Whatever happens in our classrooms, the more potent and ongoing kind of education takes place on the airwaves and on our screens. Cocooned in classrooms for only our first eighteen years or so, we effectively spend the rest of our lives under the tutelage of news entities which wield infinitely greater influence over us than any academic institution can. Once our formal education has finished, the news is the teacher.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is the single most significant force setting the tone of public life and shaping our impressions of the community beyond our own walls. It is the prime creator of political and social reality. As revolutionaries well know, if you want to change the mentality of a country, you don&rsquo;t head to the art gallery, the department of education, or the homes of famous novelists; you drive the tanks straight to the nerve centre of the body politic, the news HQ.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This brings me to the @abcnews_au Instagram account.</p>
<p>Am I the only one who feels like the ABC News social media department - deliberately separating them from the local radio stations and their social media teams, TV stations and iView and the TV social media, the website, the apps, and the actual news being broadcast wherever ABC News broadcasts end up - is off charter?</p>
<p>Here are a few posts from the last week I do not feel are adding to our sense of national (Australian) identity or reflecting the cultural diversity of the Australian culture.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/359/2024/screenshots-from-the-abc-news-instagram-account-from-july-2024.png" alt="Screenshots from the ABC News Instagram Account from July 2024" title="Screenshots from the ABC News Instagram Account from July 2024"></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all innocent content, getting some great views and metrics for the team, but I raise the following issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attention is one of the greatest assets online today, only second to original content. The ABC is wasting content creation resources and our attention. Tell the great Aussie stories that add to or reflect the Australian story, and let the content farms share the viral junk food stories, and let the local news outlets tell the international stories - they do it better, and we can choose to view them there already.</li>
<li>The interest-graph driven social media industry of 2024 is built on signals. Much like driving a car and we flick on the indicator to let other traffic know we&rsquo;re turning left, each time that light blinks it&rsquo;s a signal to the traffic as to your intentions. We, the consumer, have the opportunity to choose what signals we deliver, which content we like, share, comment on, and mute, but the ABC also holds a great responsibility to deliver signals to the interest graph.</li>
<li>The ABC has many different outlets for great content like this, can the News be sanitised to just be the plain-old-boring, need-to-know, news, all the news fit-to-print someone once said.</li>
<li>I could be wrong on this and await your well-written feedback as to how I am. Seriously, every time I bring this up with broadcast friends they look at me weird as if engagement and growth at all costs is the only thing that matters.</li>
</ol>
<p>And a few questions I&rsquo;m pondering:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do the ABC staff know if they are being successful? Is content like this the only way for some social media person to keep their job because it gets numbers?</li>
<li>How do they know if they are meeting the charter?</li>
<li>Is feedback like this welcome?</li>
<li>I know that ABC funding is contentious, how can the good burghers of Australia shape our government, and instruct it, so we have an ABC that our great grandchildren will be proud of in 100 years?</li>
<li>What is the ABC News social media accounts for? Are they for content like this?</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ll end on this word from Alain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>News organisations are coy about admitting that what they present us with each day are minuscule extracts of narratives whose true shape and logic can generally only emerge from a perspective of months or even years &ndash; and that it would hence often be wiser to hear the story in chapters rather than snatched sentences. They are institutionally committed to implying that it is inevitably better to have a shaky and partial grasp of a subject this minute than to wait for a more secure and comprehensive understanding somewhere down the line.</p>

			 <p>My local laundromat in Passignano is closed on Sundays so I journeyed over to Perugia, Umbria, for my clothes washing today, caught a glance of something that looked like a monorail, turned out it was a MiniMetro, a “family of cable propelled automated people mover systems”</p>
<p>Quoting Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Perugia People Mover:</strong> In Perugia, a 3,027-meter (9,931 ft; 1.881 mi) stretch with seven stations opened in February 2008 to relieve the inner city of car traffic. It consists of more than 25 vehicles of 5 m (16 ft 4+7⁄8 in) each, with a capacity of 25 passengers and a speed of up to 25 kilometers (16 mi) per hour. The interval between successive vehicles is around 1.5 minutes. In 2013, the system carried 10,000 passengers per day.</p>
</blockquote>

In most cases, people get stuck in those patterns, just like grooves in a record, and they never get out of them. It’s a rare person who etches grooves that are other than a specific way of looking at things, a specific way of questioning things. It’s rare that you see an artist in his 30s or 40s able to really contribute something amazing. Of course, there are some people who are innately curious, forever little kids in their awe of life, but they’re rare.</p>

<p>A lot of the people talking about AI today are olds - like me. I&rsquo;ve been driving around Italy this week hearing my favourite podcasters, and reading my favourite writers, wax lyrical about artificial intelligence, Apple Intelligence, generative AI, large language models, and the like with fear and loathing. Age changes us but it feels similar to my childhood, predominately the early 90s where &ldquo;olds&rdquo; were fearful and against the incoming technological change whilst I was so eager to play, toy, and learn.</p>
<p>I think about the earliest stories I&rsquo;ve read of the 1984 Macintosh being shown to olds but it was the kids that really got it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.folklore.org/A_Mac_For_Mick.html">Andy Hertzfeld writes</a> about Steve Jobs delivering a Mac to Mick Jagger the weekend before the computer launched:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fortunately, Mick&rsquo;s twelve year old daughter Jade had followed Mick into the room, and her eyes lit up when she saw MacPaint. Bill began to teach her how to use it, and pretty soon she was happily mousing away, fascinated by what she could do with MacPaint. Even though Mick drifted off to another room, the Apple contingent stayed with Jade for another half hour or so, showing off the Macintosh and answering her questions, and ended up leaving the machine with her, since she couldn&rsquo;t seem to part with it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the story from a day or two earlier of Steve Jobs taking a Mac to Sean Lennon&rsquo;s 9th birthday party where Walter Cronkite, Andy Warhol, and Yoko Ono were in attendance. John Lennon&rsquo;s son took to the computer right away, but Andy Warhol was enamoured by the machine.</p>
<p>Warhol wrote in his diary that night, “I felt so old and out of it with this young whiz guy right there who’d helped invent it.”</p>
<p>Me too, Andy. Me too. I just try every day to be one of those people who are innately curious, forever little kids in their awe of life.</p>

<p>The Pentax 17 has a 25mm F3.5 lens which works out at 37mm equivalent, and derives its name from the horizontal width of the 17 x 25mm frames it captures. The company says the vertical format makes it similar to images shot by smartphones.</p>

			 <p>Shalom Auslander:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was thinking about sex the other day because I was having a really depressing day, and a dead body had been found by the pier, and as I was taking my son to school and waiting at a traffic light, a homeless man in a mad fury began circling my car, shouting and spitting, and it felt like forever before the light turned green and I thought I needed to get my mind settled so I went to a bookstore and all the books were about how to succeed in business, and about how to work even more, and there was a whole section about how to use the ancient philosophy of Stoicism to get ahead in your corporate career, and outside the bookstore people were sleeping on the sidewalk and there was a store where shoes were 30% off and still cost two-hundred dollars and I stopped to write at a coffeeshop where people were arguing about politics and war and fascism and genocide and a woman at the table beside me was talking loudly at the people on her laptop screen, who were talking loudly at her about the client and the presentation and the need for a more aggressive social media marketing plan, and as I drove home the billboards and buses were covered with advertisements for movies, and the people in the advertisements were giants, and they were perfect, and they were revered and admired like Gods and most of them were actually truly awful people who shouldn’t be admired at all and so by the time I got home, I crawled into bed and I closed my eyes and a moment later, I heard a little girl outside my window, and she was crying and shouting and her mother asked her what was wrong and she shouted, at the top of her little lungs, “EVERYTHING TODAY MAKES NO SENSE!” and I thought that must have felt really good, I would love to scream like that right now, I would love nothing more than to scream “EVERYTHING TODAY MAKES NO SENSE!” and how that would make me feel better than sex, better than the best sex better than all the sex in the world, and that’s why I was thinking about sex the other day.</p>

<hr>
<p>I loved running defrag.exe on DOS and then Windows as often as possible.</p>
<p>It was one part &ldquo;I’m doing God’s work,&rdquo; one part &ldquo;this will totally speed the computer up,&rdquo; even though it only slightly affected performance, one part &ldquo;looking under the hood,&rdquo; which is an element of computing I dearly miss today, and one part just sitting there for an hour watching the defragger defrag.</p>
<p>A file, say your homework – homework.doc – might have been saved in position 1045 on the spinning hard disk. However, it might have needed 10 positions, but only positions 1045 to 1050 were free, so the last five parts would be placed later on the disk where there was free space. Then, if you wanted to access that document, the disk would be spinning back and forth between the two different positions on the disk.</p>
<p>Defragmenting would bring all the bits together by moving other bits out of the way.</p>
<p>Watching the defragger run you built such an intimate relationship with your file system, operating system, documents, applications (we called them programs at the time), files, games, etc.</p>
<p>In some defragmentation apps, they would show you which file it was working on at that time, and if you were nerdy enough, you’d come to know all the files, even operating system files. When you only had 100 or a few hundred megabytes on a disk, you’d have to sacrifice things like help files, unneeded applications or operating system features, or Minesweeper if you wanted to install a new program or game.</p>
<p>It really was a beautiful time to use a computer.</p>
<p>Miss you, defrag.exe.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s not really any room for me just to bitch and moan about being stranded at Melbourne Airport for five hours this morning when I want to be home.</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s for the better. Who wants to hear about me being stranded to Melbourne Airport?</p>
<p>The thing I miss though is that sharing our mundane life was a fundamental part of the social web 15 years ago and I miss your food photos and flights delay posts.</p>

			 <p>A quick search on the internet for <strong>Stan Hillard</strong> doesn&rsquo;t reveal much. You&rsquo;ll find my name-dropping about a decade ago on <a href="https://radiotoday.com.au/community-radio-should-be-cut-off/">Radio Today</a> as I trample on the great legacy of community radio in Australia, you&rsquo;ll also find that Stan was most recently the President of <a href="https://2wayfm.com.au/about-us/our-team/dscn0037/">2WAY FM</a> and was even presenting radio shows last week. He <a href="https://uninewsarchive.cqu.edu.au/uninews.cqu.edu.au/UniNews/viewStory8424.html?story=863">loved the theatre</a>, and even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBvVi_gdGR4">acting</a> if we&rsquo;re allowed to call whatever is in that YouTube video as acting.</p>
<p>I met Stan on my first day at 4CRM, Mackay&rsquo;s Community Radio station early 2004. I&rsquo;d always wanted to be on the radio, firstly because I&rsquo;d admired everything I&rsquo;d heard come out of Triple J, Hot FM, and 4MK&rsquo;s transmitters since I was a little boy, and secondly because it was the closest I could ever come to being heard - something that didn&rsquo;t happen much for this kid from a broken home. I walked past and saw a sign on the door about learning radio.</p>
<p><em>This post to the usenet group aus.radio.broadcast recalls the moment in terific hi skool dropout englissh</em></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I went up the radio station stairs expecting to find out about some big course and the next day, after talking to station manager Allan Berry, I was in the studio with Stan.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Dig deeper on Google for Stan and you&rsquo;ll find a story from the <a href="https://www.alicespringsnews.com.au/0502.html">Alice Spring News reported on February 11, 1998</a>, a story containing an anecdote about colour TV coming to the region:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Alice Springs finally got TV in 1970, it could have gone straight to colour. However, the ABC, the sole transmitter at the time, had put a colour bar on its equipment. &ldquo;Nobody realised this,&rdquo; recalls Murray, &ldquo;but we had a technician here called Stan Hillard in charge of the transmitter. He went to Adelaide and while he was having a look at their equipment, he noticed the colour bar, pulled it out and all of a sudden Alice Springs had colour. &ldquo;He got into hot water for doing this, the ABC were going to reinstate black and white but the Northern Territory Government intervened, someone in the ABC got their knuckles rapped and Stan was a hero for the town!&rdquo; Murray has heard that Stan now lives in Rockhampton.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Born on March 11, 1947, Stan passed away this last week, and although the internet leaves much to be imagined about Stan, his leadership, training, and guidance in the early days of my career were foundational and I wanted to honour his legacy by repeating what he taught me on my first day in front of a microphone, before which he&rsquo;d taught me how to panel a radio show. <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/07/29/imagine-your-audience.html">I quoted Stan on this blog last year</a>, but I share again to honour the mark Stan left on my life and career, and so the people at the back can hear it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine the audience are the stupidest people alive then treat them with the upmost respect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s my golden rule for broadcasting, publishing, posting, tweeting, threading, tooting, facebooking, gramming, or microblogging. Imagine for just one minute that the people reading this thing, or hearing it, and they have no idea what you&rsquo;re talking about - explain it to them in a quick and simple way so they may understand and perhaps even engage.</p>
<p>Whenever I&rsquo;ve failed in life it&rsquo;s almost likely because I&rsquo;ve ignored or failed to employ that golden rule.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2024/04/25/in-will-we.html">In 2115 will we still commemorate Anzac Day like we do today?</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2024/04/25/in-will-we.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-04-25 18:05:58 &#43;1000">Apr 25, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Anzac Day 1916 was a very different ANZAC Day compared to that I experienced in Canberra this morning. Martin Crotty, a historian at the University of Queensland, said that Anzac Day commemorations have &ldquo;suited political purposes right from 1916 when the first Anzac Day march was held in London and Australia, which were very much about trying to recruit more people to join the war during 1916-1918.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As war efforts changed over the last 109 years, and eventually subsided, the Anzac Day commemorations have taken on a more solemn and meaningful practice. After attending the 2024 Dawn Service at the Australian War Memorial this morning&ndash;my first in Canberra, and possibly my fifth as an adult&ndash;I have some thoughts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to discuss how I thought arriving half an hour early for a 5:30 am service would be &ldquo;early enough&rdquo; to secure a good viewpoint&ndash;it was not, and I&rsquo;m pretty sure that most of the 30,000 attendees beat me to the Sculpture Garden this morning. Nor will I mention how the lacklustre audio and video production at the memorial left me feeling blind and deaf, yet my hearing was sharp enough at 5:30 am to hear someone vomiting behind me and a staff member using one of those hand-held clickers commonly used by bouncers, walking through the crowd in the dark, clicking away.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t wax lyrical about how the male performers were named and the master of ceremonies asked the crowd to applaud them, yet the female performers were neither named nor acknowledged.</p>
<p>Where my mind is at, here in the Canberra Qantas Lounge at 4pm on the twenty-fifth of April, is the book I&rsquo;m currently seven percent through on my Kobo e-reader, &ldquo;Van Diemen&rsquo;s Land&rdquo; by James Boyce, and a PhD candidate from Turkey who was ahead of me in line for a bacon and egg roll after the service.</p>
<p>The PhD candidate studying tourism in Turkey has come to Australia for a few weeks to complete his study on why Australians aren&rsquo;t visiting Gallipoli for Anzac Day anymore. Apparently, for the centenary in 2015, over 40,000 Australians and New Zealanders made the pilgrimage, but numbers have significantly dropped, to about 1,500 last year.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t shake the feeling that Anzac Day needs to continue to evolve.</p>
<p>In 2115, are we expecting our great-grandchildren to be trekking to Gallipoli, or even to the Australian War Memorial, to remember the events of April 1915?</p>
<p>Or can the spirit of Anzac Day start to embody more of the Australian spirit, leading me to James Boyce&rsquo;s &ldquo;Van Diemen&rsquo;s Land&rdquo;?</p>
<p>The thorough rewriting and retelling of Tasmania&rsquo;s history should be a must-read for all Australians&ndash;not for the interest in the Apple Isle&ndash;but for a thorough understanding of the relationship between the first Australians, the early whalers and sealers, the French, the Dutch, and the British.</p>
<p>I was sold a narrative as a child that there was nothing here on Terra Australis except for some savages until the Brits arrived, and then some things happened, then we got Channel V. My little brother was born in 1988, so he got a cool birth certificate because the country was 200 years old, and I got a trip to Expo &lsquo;88. Simpler times.</p>
<p>Modern brave and valiant efforts to flesh out that story with truth, to include First Australians, their sovereignty, and their story, have undoubtedly helped me understand more about the brutality inflicted by the early settlers and the sudden change to the Aboriginal way of life&ndash; one day they&rsquo;re living their hashtag bestlife, and the next, some guy is waving a metal rod of murder towards them, killing some of their friends and family.</p>
<p>James Boyce&rsquo;s nuanced approach to the 18th and 19th-century tension has led me to a greater understanding of the times. An understanding that softens the often poisonous narrative about the early explorers and convicts, acknowledging that they were strangers in a new and foreign land, and also that the locals were being impacted by strangers in their homeland.</p>
<p>One simple story that greatly impacted me was about how back-burning was misunderstood. We now know that Australian Aborigines are experts in land and bushfire management, and we also have evidence that being caught in a bushfire isn&rsquo;t exactly conducive to survival. In what would be one of the earliest misunderstandings between local Aboriginals and settlers, the Aboriginals were back-burning on their land, as was their right and responsibility, but the British were terrified and believed they were under attack from the Aboriginals.</p>
<p>There are countless other stories from that time of the early explorers, soldiers, and convicts having extremely positive relationships with the First Australians.</p>
<p>But the scarlet thread through it all are tensions between the nations and their people.</p>
<p>The path of reconciliation made its way into the twentieth century where the First Nations people of Australia fought alongside the first immigrants of Australia in World War I, albeit paid dismally and treated worse, and still today our people struggle with that tension between our peoples, working feverishly to close that gap and heal the wounds.</p>
<p>I was reminded of that as one of the speakers at the War Memorial dawn service this morning recounted the 1944 story of the Battle of Leyte Gulf in the Philippines, where HMAS Australia was attacked by the Japanese.</p>
<p>In 2024, Japan is the number one nation Australians are visiting&ndash;willingly, for leisure and fun&ndash;only 80 years after we lost thirty Australians to a Japanese kamikaze aircraft attack.</p>
<p>The story I see being told on Anzac Day 2115 is a story of principles being held and fought for, and tensions being identified and resolved, a story of reconciliation.</p>
<p>Perhaps today we can start sharing that beautiful, rich, and rare story of resolved tension, principles of treaty between the First Australian nations and those of us who come across the seas for the boundless plains to share. May we advance Australia fair.</p>

			 <p>Kids, gather round for an Australian TV, culture, and music history lesson.</p>
<p>On Instagram ABC TV&rsquo;s Rage account <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C6C8FqKPutV/">posted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anyone remember when <a href="https://micro.blog/abctv">@abctv</a> used to close down overnight? …. Neither do we 😏 Back before rage took control of the late night silver screen in 1987, this station closer was played out to signify the end of the day’s programming to the tune of Mike Oldfield’s track ‘Wonderful Land’. Another beauty from the rage archives!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is missing an unimportant piece of fact which is linked to an only slightly more interesting story about Australian music.</p>
<p>Back in the old old days ABC TV would close overnight and it would be a number of hours - dependent on day and programming etc - until Rage would start. For the uninitiated, Rage is like MTV in 1982 if it was public access, government-funded, basically no hosts unless there was a band guest-hosting for a few hours. It was just non-stop music videos.</p>
<p>And for those of us (darn youth) who might have stayed up that late at night, &lsquo;waiting for Rage&rsquo; became a thing &hellip; if you were lazy or had no video tapes to watch or nothing else to do you&rsquo;d leave the TV on waiting for Rage to begin in silence with nothing on the screen.</p>
<p>This lead to the bad Seven 8ths Torn self-titled album final track called &ldquo;Waiting for Rage!&rdquo; which was something like 16 minutes of silence.</p>

<p>And yes, I am contemplating spending $44 just to <a href="https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/293808446212">buy this album on eBay</a>, the listing from which I grabbed those images, it&rsquo;s potentially the last remaining copy.</p>
<p>I say all that to say this, that Seven 8ths Torn left an impact on my youth, I saw them live at a local <a href="https://www.concertarchives.org/venues/canelands-sound-shell">sound shell</a> in a <a href="https://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/mackay/death-knell-for-park-soundshell/news-story/510b0d5f26760e1273eeb98ece21131a">park</a>, and it&rsquo;s kind of amazing that they exist in like two places on the Internet now and one of them is an eBay listing. There was a whole Triple J Unearthed series in the 90s and it doesn&rsquo;t exist online, like anywhere I can find. Triple J Unearthed held a live in-person music competition at the Canelands Sound Shell and according to what I can find online that event never occurred.</p>
<p>Some of my favourite albums I still listen to today don&rsquo;t exist online.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just kind of wild how much knowledge, culture, wisdom, art, truth, beauty exists outside the realms of Californian data centres.</p>

			 <p>As March 2024 almost comes to a close I’m reminded how it’s four years since my life fell apart.</p>
<p>Four years on I’m seeing a therapists and building a new life in Tasmania, basically starting a-fresh, it’s like 2012 all over again, the 100% brand new kid on the block.</p>
<p>Still tens thousands of dollars behind.</p>
<p>Still mentally scarred quite bad.</p>
<p>But I turned a corner recently. I was encouraged to understand that no-one from any government or any group is going to come and apologise and I need to forgive, and move on.</p>
<p>I was so busy holding on for dear life that I never even realised that I was the one holding myself back. Covid wasn&rsquo;t my fault, but letting it dictate my mental wellbeing in March 2024 is, and it&rsquo;s never too late to see a therapist and to talk honestly with friends.</p>

			 <p>A lovely Qantas flight attendant yesterday asked me if I was Josh Withers, at which point I prepare myself to say yes and have a chat to her about a wedding of mine that she attended or how she saw me on TV, like the D-Grade celebrity fool I am.</p>
<p>But no, she goes on to say how my wife is lovely and amazing. The flight attendant was planning to get married and was considering eloping so she ends up on the phone with Britt talking about eloping with The Elopement Collective.</p>
<p>Anyway, Britt really is all that and more, you know.</p>
<p>I was planning on singing her praises today anyway but I’ve opened up the old social media today and found it to be International Women’s Day, so it’s an even better reason to scream her name from the rooftops.</p>
<p>Not only is she the best person in my world, plus she made me a father of two of my other favourite humans, but Britt also spends countless hours each week counselling the brides and grooms of Australia about getting married, whether they should elope or not and whether or not we’re the best place for them to do that.</p>
<p>I’ve always said the thing about being remarkable is that remarkable people are easily remarked on, you are able to remark on them because their talent, beauty, smarts, intelligence is so easily witnessed.</p>

			 <p>Prediction: Wedding photography is about to undergo a massive change.</p>
<p>The people who hold cameras like
Fuji/Sony/Canon/Nikon need to figure out how to get their JPEGs right in camera.</p>
<p>They might still deliver a cull of 30 odd photos a week or three later, but the expectation is moving to fast turnaround.</p>
<p>The lovely iPhone holding kids - content creators - will fade away as professionals figure out how to deliver in minutes instead of months. Or maybe they don’t fade but they take up the bottom end of the marketer.</p>
<p>The added benefit is that because of the increased efficiency, wedding photographers will be able to take on more work. Where a wedding might have been five to ten days work, so you would be limited to maybe 30-40 weddings a year, accounting for seasonal influxes, now that same photographer might take on double the work to achieve same pay, effectively reducing the price of wedding photography because it requires less energy and effort.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m thoroughly convinced that email can be a meaningful method of communication, relationship, community, and entertainment in the future. I&rsquo;ve always been proud of what my friend <a href="https://micro.blog/james@bne.social">@james@bne.social</a> is making at <a href="http://podnews.net">@podnews.net</a> so reading <a href="https://www.editorandpublisher.com/stories/newsletter-20-the-emergence-of-single-page-media,248246">this article</a> by Guy Tasaka encourages me in my little prophetic thought.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have a deep appreciation for newsletters. They say everything old is new again. Today, with an almost overwhelming amount of information we must sift through on news sites, social media and third-party aggregation sites, like Apple and Google News, it’s nice to have information curated and summarized for me and delivered to my inbox. That kind of sounds like a newspaper.</p>

			 <p>The CEO of the biggest supermarket chain in Australia is stepping down because no other news media dared question an advertiser.</p>
<p>This is the strength and power of listener/reader supported media, and the strength of publicly funded media.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t lose an advertiser because you asked good questions, because you aren&rsquo;t reliant on, or don&rsquo;t have, advertisers.</p>
<p>Our reluctance to individually fund good journalism are part of the reason our groceries are so expensive, that and because we&rsquo;re too lazy to shop around, or better, buy local food from local producers.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I recently had the opportunity to express my interest in a field I&rsquo;ve never officially worked in, for a company I&rsquo;d never worked for, in an industry I&rsquo;ve been out of for over a decade: audio, more specifically, audio on-demand, or as we&rsquo;ve called it for twenty years, podcasting.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t make it past expressing interest for the position but my <a href="https://headofaudioondemand.com">application - in the form of audio on demand</a> - was &ldquo;one of the most creative submissions I’ve seen/heard&rdquo; said an ABC executive, which I sincerely appreciate, but my fire and passion for podcasting/audio on-demand has now been given oxygen - after over a decade of self-employment I applied for the job intending to get it.</p>
<p>So, I wanted to at least document my thoughts here on my blog, and then open source them, release my thoughts to the greater podcasting public.</p>
<p>May these gathered thoughts help or inspire you to succeed in the field, even if you got the job as Head of Audio on Demand for the ABC ;)</p>
<h2 id="what-i-would-do-if-i-was-the-abcs-head-of-audio-on-demand">What I would do if I was the ABC&rsquo;s Head of Audio on Demand</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create a role of tastemaker for the network.</strong> They&rsquo;re the evangelist for the entire network of shows large and small. They themselves release a regular podcast but are also actively blogging and social media creating about episodes and shows. They&rsquo;re the network&rsquo;s number one fan and advocate.</li>
<li><strong>Serve the niches to an extreme.</strong> Look for the small, weird, wonderful communities and interests. Niche passions are infectious, interesting, and lead to great audiences. Think Francis Bourgeois.</li>
<li><strong>Serve local extremely well.</strong> The ABC already does this so well on every other medium, but the town of Esperance deserves a local daily podcast, as much as the region of Greater Sydney does along with Penrith. Every Australian should have a local podcast they MUST listen to, like it&rsquo;s the gospel.</li>
<li><strong>Up the metadata game.</strong> In radio we called the 1% of ultra-mad fans P1 fans, I was told it was because they had our station on preset one. P1 fans love the metadata that makes podcasts so more enjoyable, things like chapters for skipping to topics, unique and captivating album art per episode, and also album art to visually explain chapters. Like if a chart is mentioned, the chart is that album&rsquo;s artwork. Metadata includes utilising all of the podcast specifications like categories, episode and season numbers, trailer identifiers, podcast:person tags, and show notes with links to things and people mentioned. Look at <a href="https://podnews.net/articles/how-to">Podnews&rsquo; How-To articles</a> and <a href="https://podcasting2.org/">podcasting2.org</a> and get your CMS or software developers to build support for all the apps.</li>
<li><strong>Album art like Mr Beast.</strong> YouTuber Mr Beast knows that the thumbnail of a video is almost more important than the content, it&rsquo;s what brings people into the episode. Album art is a neglected wasteland in podcasting, up your game.</li>
<li><strong>Unearthed for podcasting.</strong> I can still remember when Triple J Unearthed came to Mackay - my friend Leah even has video of me at the event {<a href="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-02-14-at-20.03.492x.png">screen grab of the video to prove I was young once</a>}. Over the past thirty years Unearthed has provided an amazing platform for the up and coming musical acts of Australia. I&rsquo;m dreaming of a similar program for podcasters. An on ramping exercise to the wider network, developing talent, encouraging it, providing resources and assistance.</li>
<li><strong>Success, how do we measure it?</strong> The <a href="https://tritonrankers.com/rankers/au/podcasts/">Triton Digital Australian Podcast Ranker</a> provides a nice big list of podcast success, but I would sincerely ask all stakeholders whether that listing defines our success or not. I just think of my own podcasting efforts as a wedding celebrant. I would have one of the least successful podcasts in the universe but I&rsquo;m probably a top 1% earner because everyone that listens to my podcast books me to be their celebrant. No podcaster is getting that kind of return from each listener.</li>
<li><strong>Expanding what audio on demand means.</strong> We all know what a podcast is supposed to look like today. A regular release, either daily, weekly, monthly, of a drop of audio. But if we look at audio like we do video, there&rsquo;s feature films, short films, miniseries, documentaries, anthology series, reality TV, &lsquo;straight to home video&rsquo; films. How can some of those storytelling mediums be transposed to audio, and could they be released from the &ldquo;release date&rdquo; that immediately dates a podcast when released?</li>
<li><strong>Embracing the open web and our own platform.</strong> Anil Dash recently wrote this great piece, <a href="https://www.anildash.com/2024/02/06/wherever-you-get-podcasts">&ldquo;Wherever you get your podcasts&rdquo; is a radical statement</a>, and I agree, and will wholeheartedly fight for the open web. The simple fact that you or I can publish a website or a podcast without needing permission from Zuckerberg, whoever is running Spotify, or Tim Cook. But then it also makes a lot of sense for a publisher to own its platform, like the ABC does with ABC Listen. So find the balance between the two.</li>
<li><strong>Drop introductions for audio logos.</strong> Think of the Netflix Tudum or the Apple Macintosh or Windows XP startup sound. Instead of wasting precious seconds at the start and end of a podcast, employ an audio logo. The first seconds of a podcast are where the decisions to keep on listening are made, don&rsquo;t waste it with lots of fancy talk about how we&rsquo;re listening to another ABC Podcast.</li>
<li><strong>Debate what we&rsquo;re calling this.</strong> Before Ben Hammersly mashed together the words iPod and broadcast it was called audioblogging. Today we&rsquo;re playing with the term &ldquo;audio on-demand&rdquo; but it doesn&rsquo;t exactly roll off the tongue. My gripe is that people call videos on Youtube a podcast. The terminology is messy, and potentially there&rsquo;s no fix, but somehow everyone agreed on what radio meant. Maybe the same can happen with recorded audio delivered on RSS or the web at your leisure?</li>
<li><strong>Spread it far and wide with the wheel of content.</strong> I&rsquo;m not going to make out like this is a Josh original, but I&rsquo;ve been banging on about this since I worked at Southern Cross Austereo, 96five, 4BC and Fairfax radio, and everyone there looked at me like I was crazy. It&rsquo;s my &ldquo;<a href="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2024/wheel-of-content.jpeg">Wheel of Content</a>&rdquo; idea. The simple idea is that a story enters the wheel at the hub (the middle), and then it works itself out through the different channels, audio, video, text, short form, longform, infographics, social media posts, all of it. Record the podcast, break it out into a number of blog posts, into smaller podcast episodes, into videos, tweets, posts, toots, whatever. Make that content work not just double time but 10x its usability. Get the story out of the mp3 file and run it far and wide.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-guest.</strong> Introduce hosts and personalities from across the network as guests on other podcasts. Pretend like you&rsquo;re not the only podcast in the network.</li>
<li><strong>A big head with a long tail.</strong> This is my final thought that encapsulates all of them. Any one network can most likely only afford the social capital to market ten shows a year well. We&rsquo;re talking large-scale marketing campaigns. But that same network should have 10x (at least) that number shows it is actively producing. This is not a new idea, Netflix and many streaming apps work the same way. Evangelism is a costly exercise, so evangelise the hits, and let the rest of the network ride off that network-effect of getting listeners interested in the rest of the shows. Build a big fat visible head of up to ten shows, and let that tail grow as long as you can resource.</li>
</ul>
<p>So much credit to friends for hearing me talk about podcasts and this job in particular so much, but also credit to industry leaders I’ve either been lucky enough to call friend, or have watched esnrestly from afar, like Cameron Reilly, James Cridland, and Scotty McDonald, and then Marco Arment with Overcast and ATP, plus Myke and Stephen of Relay FM who have been doing lots of this for a while already.</p>

			 <h1 id="40-years-of-the-mac-and-why-i-cant-use-anything-else-now">40 years of the Mac and why I can&rsquo;t use anything else now</h1>
<p>By the time I was buying my first Apple Macintosh computer the launch of the Mac in 1984 was already a myth, a story shared from one nerd to another, like in an Aboriginal Australian cave painting.</p>
<p>In grade five there was an Apple IIe at the back of the classroom no-one knew how to use but when I realised that the computer magazines at the library full of computer programs and games written in Basic contained not just ideas and lines of code - yes, actual real code just printed in paper magazines - but code I could type into an Apple computer, execute, and then enjoy, I was hooked.</p>
<p>I kept on reading those computer magazines like APCMag, PC User, PCMag, Macuser, Mac Format, and countless others whose names escape me but the school library stocked so generously.</p>
<p>At one stage I designed on paper my dream computer which would triple-boot Microsoft Windows, OS/2 Warp, and Mac OS System 8. I think a &ldquo;Mac on a PCI card&rdquo; product had been released, or the opposite for inserting in a Mac, so I designed my Frankenstein&rsquo;s monster of a computer and presented it to class imagining that they would a) care, and b) be in awe of my product design and computer engineering.  Alas neither Steve Jobs or Bill Gates wrote and congratulated me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how I wrangled it, but somehow our family acquired a Packard Bell IBM-compatible personal computer with a 486 SX 25/33 processor, 4MB of RAM, no sound card, but it did come with Windows 3.11.</p>
<p>The Radio Rentals rented computer and I quickly became close friends but somehow with its 25MHz CPU and 4MB of RAM the computer ran slower than a slug chasing down an ice cream truck.</p>
<p>Enter, my Uncle Grant.</p>
<p>Uncle Grant was my super uncle from Townsville who sold and serviced Apple computers. We&rsquo;d not been on friendly talking terms about computers since I used his Apple Macintosh and neglected to save a document he had open, but he was quick to diagnose the problem with my computer&rsquo;s speed: I had an image as my desktop wallpaper. Also, he was quick to quip that &ldquo;a Mac wouldn&rsquo;t have that problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What he neglected to acknowledge is that a Withers didn&rsquo;t have a spare buck either so we went without a Mac for about a decade more.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m sure is the story for most modern Mac users, having your own personal Macintosh Desktop Experience was a dream for too long.</p>
<p>Years later Apple announced the Intel transition from Power PC chipsets and all of a sudden, thanks to an Intel Inside and Bootcamp, these new Macs can run Windows and Mac OS X which is the perfect justification for a nerd to make for a new Apple MacBook purchase.</p>
<p>All white and plastic, it was beautiful, and that new Apple MacBook never needed to be tainted by Bootcamp and Windows. It turned out that Mac OS is actually quite capable on its own.</p>
<p>Not quite as beautiful as that G3 iMac I acquired years after it was ever useful, but always be beautiful.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I can&rsquo;t use any other OS today. I&rsquo;ve tried Windows and Linux of late, I&rsquo;m always open to a change so I know I&rsquo;m using the best tools for the job, but my taste gravitates to the Mac. It is beautiful, useful, and just plain nice. I&rsquo;ve even tried the iPad as a main computer, or the phone. But it&rsquo;ll always be the Mac for me. Happy birthday, and hello, old friend.</p>

			 <p>Marketing is actually part of the product.</p>
<p>That’s an intangible element of Apple products that is often missed by the Android, Windows, Meta Quest commenters.</p>
<p>Sure, the other products do “the same things” the Apple products does, but Samsung, Microsoft, Meta, Google marketing is woeful.</p>
<p>This isn’t an Apple thing, this is a human thing. Some of us just want to be a part of something beautiful and cool.</p>
<p>An Apple invoice and delivery is not just some plastic and metal, software, and some USB cords. It’s also a story, a narrative that some people with certain taste, would like to purchase.</p>
<p>And the rest of you can go use your Android, Dell, Meta Quest.</p>

			 <p>Linking to, sharing, telling people about podcasts is a hard problem to solve. If only because I personally do most of my listening while driving.</p>
<p>So I was reminded this morning to link to a project and podcast I&rsquo;ve been really enjoying, <a href="https://micro.blog/martinfeld">@martinfeld</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.rsspod.net/">Really Specific Stories</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Really Specific Stories is a part of a broader PhD project, in collaboration with Dr. Kate Bowles and Dr. Christopher Moore at the University of Wollongong. Each episode includes an interview with a producer or listener from a selected tech podcast case study and uses the qualitative method of narrative enquiry to uncover their experiences. Down the line, responses from each interview will be included in a final PhD thesis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They&rsquo;re all good, and this probably speaks more to my specific brand of nerdery than the quality of the episode, but I&rsquo;ve personally enjoyed <a href="https://micro.blog/gruber">@gruber</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.rsspod.net/john-gruber">episode</a>, <a href="https://www.rsspod.net/marco-arment">Marco Arment&rsquo;s</a>, <a href="https://www.rsspod.net/john-siracusa">john Siracusa&rsquo;s</a>, <a href="https://www.rsspod.net/stephen-hackett">Stephen Hackett&rsquo;s</a>, <a href="https://www.rsspod.net/casey-liss">Casey Liss&rsquo;s</a>, <a href="https://www.rsspod.net/manton-reece">Manton Reece&rsquo;s</a>, <a href="https://www.rsspod.net/daniel-jalkut">Daniel Jalkut&rsquo;s</a>, <a href="https://www.rsspod.net/jean-macdonald">Jean Macdonald&rsquo;s</a>, and <a href="https://www.rsspod.net/andrew-canion">Andrew Canion&rsquo;s</a> episodes .. that said, they&rsquo;re all great recordings about a very specific time in history, the time that tech podcasts became a thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A different take on what makes us feel so busy, stressed, and anxious.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As a rule, the larger your surface area, the more energy you have to expend maintaining it. Of course, when most of us think of surface area, we think of the area of a rectangle or how much grass we have to mow. But there is a surface area of life, and most of us never realize how much it consumes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have one house, you have a relatively small surface area to maintain (depending on the age and size of the house, of course). If you buy another one, your surface area expands. But it doesn&rsquo;t expand linearly - it expands slightly above that. It&rsquo;s all the same work plus more.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Friends are another type of surface area. You have a finite amount of time to spend with friends before you die. The more friends you have, the less time you can spend with each one individually.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Money is another form of surface area. The more money you have, the more you have to keep track of different types of assets and investments.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When your surface area expands too much, you hire people to help you scale. Assistants, property managers, family offices, etc. They&rsquo;re scaling you - but they&rsquo;re also scaling the surface area of responsibility. This, of course, only masks the rapidly expanding surface area by abstracting it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Beliefs are another type of surface area.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The thing about surface area is that the more you have, the more you have to defend and maintain. The larger your surface area, the more you are burdened with mentally and physically.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you think in terms of surface area, it&rsquo;s easy to see why we are so anxious, stressed, and constantly behind.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We feel like we need more time, but what we&rsquo;re craving is more focus. What we need is a smaller surface area.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Your surface area becomes part of your identity. She&rsquo;s the &lsquo;busy person&rsquo; with her hand in every project. He&rsquo;s the guy with four houses.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Competition can drive expansion. Most people want a bigger house to compete with someone else who has a nicer house. We are animals, after all. On a group level, this causes great benefits. On an individual level, it can cause unhappiness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most of the really happy people I know have a relatively small surface area. I know billionaires with two houses. Most of my close friends only have 4-5 close friends - everyone else is a friend in the loose sense of the word. Most of the productive people I know at work are focused on one or two things, not 5.</p>
<p>The way to maximize your enjoyment in life is to keep your surface area small. It&rsquo;s a lot of work but if the happiest people I know are any indication, it&rsquo;s a lot less work to keep it small than to maintain it when it&rsquo;s large.</p>

			 <p>A Brisbane based <a href="https://www.instagram.com/joinflashback/">crew</a> have delivered on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joinflashback/flashback-a-camera-for-the-small-moments/">their Kickstarter promise to deliver a &ldquo;camera for the small moments&rdquo;, the Flashback Camera</a>. It&rsquo;s a digital film camera, or a film-like digital camera more to the point.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/359/2024/0d71bc68-ec2a-4d32-a726-d615e54bd1e1.jpg" alt="The Flashback camera from Kickstarter"></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an avid Kickstarter backer, but especially for cool gadgets like this, and it was a pleasure to unpack.</p>
<p>The idea is to take the point-and-shoot disposable film camera vibe to a digital setting, mainly for the purposes of getting off our phones, disposing of cameras a lot less, and making memories.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/359/2024/09765e35-2cda-4dd8-815a-361f45b25fbe.jpg" alt="The Flashback camera from Kickstarter"></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a full review in me, instead, a reflection on having used it for a week: it&rsquo;s a lot of fun and a beautifully made product.</p>
<p>I have but one issue, probably the same one that everyone who has ever clicked the shutter on their iPhone then instantly been able to share and edit the photo.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joinflashback/flashback-a-camera-for-the-small-moments/posts/4000934?ref=ksr_email_backer_project_update_registered_users">update</a> today the makers have expanded on the feature I find most annoying. That at the end of the arbitrary digital film roll of 27 photos it takes about 48 hours for the photos to &ldquo;develop&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The processing done to develop your photos is currently too intensive to run on a mobile device. Over the last 2 years, we developed our own effects. In particular, our method to generate film grain is complex. Often, &ldquo;film grain&rdquo; effects are based on adding random digital noise, but true film grain is fundamentally different. Analog images are composed of grains, not pixels, and our method follows this closely. Our vision for this product has always been to stay true to the analog world, and we&rsquo;ve worked hard to never compromise on that. If we were satisfied with simple filters, we could run them inside the app, but we continue to believe that our current setup is the most flexible in providing the best possible photos from this camera.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/359/2024/f72fa46d-4ded-471a-be00-5e874018a245.jpg" alt="The Flashback camera from Kickstarter"></p>
<p>Personally, I think there would be greater customer satisfaction if that 48 hour time period was minimised to the actual required time to process, and ultimately that could be brought on to the device. I think the iPhone CPU has proven itself to be apt at processing photos.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/359/2024/51c47bdc-6e21-4e4c-9f44-8f565ea7ce58.jpg" alt="The Flashback camera from Kickstarter"></p>
<p>It would be nice if the processed photos had better metadata as well, like orientation of photo, date and time that was correct, that the flash even if enabled accidentally by fat fingers wouldn&rsquo;t fire in full sun, and ultimately this last one is just me being really nerdy: GPS co-ordinates of photos so the captured memories end up in iCloud Photo Library memories.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s some demo photos take over the weekend in Exmouth and the Gold Coast &hellip;</p>

			 <p>Drove the 90 minutes from Exmouth to photograph the sunset in Coral Bay this afternoon and also see the couple I&rsquo;m marrying this weekend, and after the sun had set I found that all the local restaurants all had 90 minute waits, so I thought, I could just drive back to Exmouth for dinner.</p>
<p>Alas, everything in Exmouth was closed, not even a vending machine for a chocolate.</p>
<p>So I present to you my art from today, art quite literally made by a starving artist.</p>

			 <p>I wrote this <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2023/64e5580ec0.jpg">eight years ago on Facebook</a>. I think it’s more valid today plus I want to preserve it on my blog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With all of our books, albums, magazines, and letters going digital and stored outside of the physical and easily visible realm, how will our kids discover that album that dad loved, or that magazine that mum kept?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I remember that &ldquo;already in our house from mum and dad&rdquo; discovery being a big thing for me.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I love Led Zeppelin and Sheryl Crow because I found the album at home. I loved Nick Earl&rsquo;s ZigZag Street because it was sitting on a shelf in a room I was renting on the Gold Coast when I first worked for Sea FM. I discovered albums I still love because they were sitting on the music director&rsquo;s desk and they weren&rsquo;t on demo enough to give away on air. I love Smith Journal, Monocle, and Relevant Magazine because I found them on shelves, tables, coffee shops, before I ever bought them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How will our kids discover things?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Will they rely purely on people recommending things?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Recommending culture is hard. I barely ever show other people music I like because a) I don&rsquo;t want them not liking it to affect my liking it, and b) it&rsquo;s kind of rude to assume that anyone would like anything.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Passive discovery has been such a strong driving force for hundreds of years, surely that hasn&rsquo;t been replaced with trending topics, Facebook shares, and retweets?</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s amazing how close Google is to upsetting the iMessage monopoly and I&rsquo;m betting they&rsquo;ll let go of the opportunity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just started using Google Chat for a new project and it&rsquo;s actually not terrible. For someone in the Apple ecosystem, it&rsquo;s not far from being as good as iMessage.</p>
<p>They need a native Mac app that works like a Mac app, and their iPhone app needs to work in with the share sheet API, but it&rsquo;s close.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re so busy fighting for iMessage to accept RCS/Google that they&rsquo;ll no doubt miss this opportunity to just put iMessage out of business.</p>

<p>Uluru is such an icon. Its simple beautiful existence is one of my earliest memories, reading about it in encyclopaedias or National Geographic and Australian Geographic magazines. Seeing it in advertisements and in movies, Oprah and Young Einstein, but back then everyone called it Ayers Rock. Today we call it what it always has been: Uluru.</p>
<p>Uluru has had a complicated 200-odd years of history. Before Europeans visited Australia for the first time, the red centre was just plodding along quite well as a special place for the Aṉangu people and neighbouring Aboriginal nations.</p>
<p>But a few years ago everything changed. In the 1870s some white blokes sighted Uluru. 1936 saw the first tourists arrive, 12 years later some tracks that would become roads were laid, and in 1959 Eddie Connellan built an airstrip. His name&rsquo;s important later on in this story.</p>
<hr>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been lucky to witness Uluru&rsquo;s glory twice now and the main difference since the last time was that in 2016 people were climbing the rock, and now in 2023 every cafe, restaurant, and bar was alive with talk about Uluru from a political point of view. Some talking about the Voice to Parliament soon going to a referendum, some talking about climbing it or why we can&rsquo;t now, others talking about everything you can or can not do in the area - like drinking and taking photos in certain areas, and most were talking about how the extraordinarily high prices for everything was married to a general lack of enthusiasm from staff for visitors to be present.</p>
<p>Most of my visit this time - aside from creating the marriage ceremony I was hired to create - was spent thinking about a comedic video I&rsquo;ve seen on social media a few times recently. The premise of the video is that before a theatre performance an MC offers an acknowledgment of country before the protagonist, an audience member, asks if everyone should leave. She says &ldquo;if we&rsquo;re on someone else&rsquo;s land, we should leave, shouldn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; going further to ask if proceeds from ticket sales were going to the owners. It&rsquo;s a joke at the expense of what can often seem like token or hollow effort to just be better about how Australia, the whole island and surrounding islands, were inhabited by intelligent, valid, interesting humans well before Europeans turned up and started naming things and claiming areas. Not just one group of people called Australia home, hundreds of different Aboriginal nations did.</p>
<p>For a few years the people new to the land were pretty bloody horrible to the locals, genocide-horrible, and in recent years current generations of leaders across the spectrum of Australian society have been throwing around the hot potato of how to deal with this generational trauma.</p>
<hr>
<p>I was born on the Gold Coast, gifted an Australian citizenship, freedom to roam this entire country (unless there&rsquo;s some pandemic apparently) and yet thrust into a political debate about being welcomed to a land, land ownership, land use, and land respect.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m voting yes for a voice to parliament, I believe it&rsquo;s the right thing to do but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the only thing we should do, there&rsquo;s a far bigger elephant in the room.</p>
<p>As native titles are transferred, and places like Uluru fall more into line with the wishes of the owners, what should happen on that land? Should we leave?</p>
<p>1993 saw the Northern Territory government acknowledge the local name of the rock in a dual naming situation, eight years after the land was returned to the original owners, but still today the airport and the resort keep the names Ayers Rock. As you enter the airport you&rsquo;ll see the name of the original airstrip builder on the building (Connellan) but to be sure not to confuse the tourists the airport you book a flight to and the motel you book a room at are the right ones, they carry the name Ayers Rock. Obviously they&rsquo;re keen on keeping that revenue, and I&rsquo;m keen to keep giving it.</p>
<p>But, customer service at most of the stores and businesses is by First National people and despite paying top-shelf prices I can&rsquo;t help but feel that they&rsquo;d be happier if we weren&rsquo;t there. After all, we were on their land and after we set up shop there (and put chains up the rock) we gave it back to them as long as we could stay.</p>
<hr>
<p>I&rsquo;m invited to Ayers Rock this week in my capacity as a wedding celebrant by a German couple who want to commit to marriage in an iconic, unforgettable, location. They plan to apply for residency and wanted to have the most Aussie wedding ever: at Uluru. (Photos below)</p>
<p>The location they choose for the ceremony seemed to be ok in my humble Australian citizen opinion. The lines on the side of the road were white (not yellow &ldquo;no stopping&rdquo; lines), and the land off the road was unfenced. So, we started exchanging vows about twenty metres off the road and quite soon after an unhappy first Nations lady, driving a Toyota land cruiser and flashing a card that meant she could tell us what to do, told us what to do and to move on. We did respectfully, to the sunset viewing area that she suggested.</p>
<p>But the overwhelming experience of Uluru for my German friends and others we talked to, second to the rock&rsquo;s overwhelming beauty, is that the rest of us aren&rsquo;t really all that welcome - but our money is.</p>
<p>Which is a confusing position to leave all of us, including  the First Nations people, in.</p>
<hr>
<p>I have a proposal for all of us to consider. Let&rsquo;s go all in. If we&rsquo;re supposed to leave, please let me know. If we&rsquo;re not supposed to be in Uluru please let Qantas and the motels know.</p>
<hr>
<p>But if we&rsquo;re going to stay, let&rsquo;s work out how we can do that in a way where I don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;ve committed genocide by asking for a $30 burger that the menu said I could have if I ordered it.</p>
<hr>
<p>And if we&rsquo;ll stay, let&rsquo;s right our wrongs as a community, as a nation, as invaders, as citizens, and as residents. This middle ground was and is necessary, like birthing pains it has been taking us somewhere beautiful, I just don&rsquo;t think anyone with the power to decide knows where we are going.</p>
<p>My family came to Australia in 1903, I sure hope that by 2103 the society my grandchildren live in will be one of unity and joy, not constant tension and racism.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s figure out where we&rsquo;re going and let&rsquo;s go there.</p>

			 <p>Shane Parrish <a href="https://fs.blog/long-game/">on playing the long game</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every action is a step toward the short game or the long game. You can’t opt out, and you can’t play a long-term game in everything. You need to pick what matters to you. But in everything you do, time amplifies the difference between strategies that work in the short term and ones that work in the long term. The long game allows you to compound results. The longer you play, the bigger the rewards.</p>

<p>Books hold most of the secrets of the world, most of the thoughts that men and women have had. And when you are reading a book, you and the author are alone together—just the two of you. A library is a good place to go when you feel unhappy,  for there, in a book, you may find encouragement and comfort. A library is a good place to go when you feel bewildered or undecided, for there, in a book, you may have your question answered. Books are good company, in sad times and happy times, for books are people—people who have managed to stay alive by hiding between the covers of a book.</p>

			 <p>Most of us, me included, can barely think past the next three minutes. We operate in this fear of lack, lack of good or sleep or money, that completely ignores the long arc of our life which gives us decades of evidence that we haven’t gone without yet, and all trend lines point to us being fine in the future.</p>
<p>That’s one of the elements of marriage I love so much.</p>
<p>In marriage you’re forced - by its very nature - to acknowledge that your life is far bigger than this three minute period of stress and anxiety we’re currently facing - in fact we have a whole life ahead of us, and considering that big picture, it’d be great to have someone else in it.</p>
<p>I’m so glad I got over myself long enough to realise that my big picture was missing you, Britt, thank you for making it so much better by simply being you.</p>
<p>Happy 11th anniversary xx</p>

			 <p>The lead singer responsible for bringing this century its greatest motivational pop/ska punk/power pop song, All Star, has passed away.</p>
<p><a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/smash-mouth-frontman-steve-harwell-dies-at-56/">Pitchfork</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steve Harwell, the founding singer of Smash Mouth, died today at his home in Boise, Idaho, of liver failure, The New York Times reports. The musician was 56 years old. Harwell dealt with alcoholism and numerous health issues in the years preceding his death.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Smash Mouth undeniably left a dent on pop culture from 1999 onwards, and when I saw the band perform in November 2018 it was stale performance from a tired Steve with a team of young local musos behind him, yet the songs struck that joyful chord in my born-in-1981 heart.</p>
<p>But I want to leave you with Steve’s 2003 cover of Neil Diamond’s You Are My Number One.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hold me down
I&rsquo;m gonna fly straight to heaven
Hold me down
Dont ever let go
I&rsquo;ve been around
You know I can&rsquo;t stay forever
And when I leave
I want you to know -
When I&rsquo;m finally gone, I&rsquo;m gonna be gone without a trace
There&rsquo;s a lot of good times ahead before we&rsquo;re done</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As someone commented on X, with Jimmy Buffet passing it’s not a great week for guys who liked to party, but it seems like Steve was self-aware enough to know that all of our days are numbered.</p>
<p>I just hope the girl with the shape of an L on her forehead had nothing to do with this.</p>

			 <p>Selling my beloved vintage Leica Z2X 35mm film camera for $700 AUD.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I bought it in Paris but I&rsquo;d like to step up to a bigger film camera. The Leica has a 35-70mm zoom lens, autofocus is super quick and precise, so no more blurry pics, smart exposure control for a point-and-shoot film camera, shutter speed ranges from a slow 1/4 sec to a fast 1/300 sec. Plus, there&rsquo;s a &ldquo;B&rdquo; setting for long exposures. Serial number is 2378996 and it&rsquo;s got that infectious red dot.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Available for pickup on the Gold Coast (Palm Beach) or I can deliver to Brisbane, Sydney, Hobart, or weirdly Uluru over the next two weeks as those are places I&rsquo;m going to be. Also driving from Sydney up to Gold Coast on Tuesday so I can deliver on the way.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Slip into my DMs if you&rsquo;re keen.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s some photos made with the camera around Paris this year. These images were scanned in Paris, I&rsquo;ve straightened a few but the colours and exposure are out of camera.</p>

			 <p>We&rsquo;re packing and getting ready for our homeward journey tonight in Paris. We&rsquo;ve got three flights left, and the longest ones just earned us a text message from Qantas letting us know that the four of us had been upgraded to business class (RIP my points balance). We&rsquo;ve got a few nights in Singapore left and it&rsquo;s back to the Southern Gold Coast after almost a year away.</p>
<p>So because I&rsquo;m a big nerd, these are our family travel stats since we left home last September and listed our home on Airbnb:</p>

<li>Countries: 10</li>
<li>Boats: 3</li>

			 <p>Another chapter in the ever-growing story of how I interact with, and use, social media:</p>
<p>I wrote a little while ago about choosing two social networks.</p>
<p>I kind of have, Mastodon and Threads/Instagram/Facebook. By which I mean that the Meta platforms all blur together with crossposting and attention.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That leaves my remaining accounts from the <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/07/06/social-media-tier.html">tier list</a>, Facebook Page, LinkedIn, and Twitter/X.</p>
<p>Rather than delete them, like I&rsquo;d rather, I&rsquo;ve trialled throwing them to ChatGPT.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still refining the prompt, but here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m asking ChatGPT 4 to do in a Zapier <a href="https://zapier.com/shared/77a57ca94af5b4ed3dce6108315eb37f001d87a5">zap</a>:</p>
<p>It starts with an instruction, or a set up which looks like this &hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are a content producer for Josh Withers the Australian wedding celebrant, a marriage celebrant famous worldwide for creating epic marriage ceremonies for adventurous people. You believe that the best kind of marriage ceremony and wedding is an intentional one, where everyone invited is invited for a reason and with a purpose, and that everything that happens at the wedding happens with intentionality and purpose. You are not necessarily against wedding traditions but you are against wedding traditions for the sake of wedding traditions. You write and speak in Australian English, and in a classic and timeless nature but with the wit and humour of Australian marriage celebrant Josh Withers. Be funny. When talking about weddings use inclusive language, use bride only if you&rsquo;re talking about a female person getting married, not as the title of the wedding industry client, and explore a diverse range of topics, cultures, and kinds of people that could get married.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I prompt it to write a post like this &hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write another new controversial tweet as Josh Withers, do not enclose it in quotation marks, written in the style of Australian wedding celebrant Josh Withers based off his writing online and on social media, asking a question or posing an thought about Josh Withers&rsquo;s wedding planning style. The tweet can be a controversial opinion about a modern, inclusive, intentional style of getting married; or an insight into modern wedding planning; or a reflection on wedding traditions of old and how they don&rsquo;t matter any more. Designed to illicit engagement and a response from people who see it. Take into account all interviews and responses by Josh Withers Australian wedding celebrant, and everything Josh has written on his online. Keep the message to under 280 characters. Do not start with greetings, do not use Australian slang like &ldquo;G&rsquo;day&rdquo;, do not use any hashtags. Be controversial and talk about all kinds of different wedding topics. Make each tweet different and unique.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s a 66% chance of the zap running that every hour, and 50% of the time the content goes to Facebook.</p>
<p>My engagement on these existing platforms has been very low for a long time, so let&rsquo;s see if this moves the needle. If not, it&rsquo;s a fun experiment into what a LLM can do for social media.</p>

<p>I am assured by our merchants, that a boy or a girl, before twelve years old, is no saleable commodity, and even when they come to this age, they will not yield above three pounds, or three pounds and half a crown at most, on the exchange; which cannot turn to account either to the parents or kingdom, the charge of nutriments and rags having been at least four times that value.

			 <p>An element of the wedding industry which offends so many inside and out, the part that eventually pushes many insiders out and back into the normal world where couples kissing in front of you all day at work is not normal, is the unreal nature of so many weddings. That for a single day people dress up and play pretend.</p>
<p>I can tell you that although I&rsquo;ve witnessed it over my fifteen years in the business, I also push back against it at every chance. I&rsquo;m also lucky that my clientele aren&rsquo;t indicative of that side of the wedding industry.</p>
<p>Which is why I love film photography. It&rsquo;s so raw and honest. Often imperfect, and perhaps with error, it&rsquo;s a plain and simple recording of the light that entered the lens at that time.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s some film photos made by my friend <a href="https://houseofloveweddings.com">James</a> at the two Italian elopements we had together last week in Tuscany.</p>

I hope you learn to be kind to yourself. I hope you fall in love with the process. I hope you see the point of pursuing passion work is not to drain yourself to create work that eclipses your life, but rather to create a life you are proud of. I hope this new venture takes you far away from conformism and enables you to make a life and a living on your own terms, with your spirit and creativity unhindered.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/08/10/colonel-sanders-and.html">Colonel Sanders and the sadness in scaling businesses</a></h1>

			 <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1976/09/09/archives/for-the-colonel-it-was-fingerlickin-bad.html">Mimi Sheraton in the New York Times in 1976</a> telling the story of walking into a KFC with Colonel Harland Sanders:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You&rsquo;re frying for 12 minutes—that&rsquo;s six minutes too long. What&rsquo;s more, your frying fat should have been changed a week ago. That&rsquo;s the worst fried chicken I&rsquo;ve ever seen. Let me see your mashed potatoes with gravy, and how do you make them?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Colonel is paid $200,000 a year to do advertising and PR for KFC, but when asked about Sanders&rsquo; remarks on the chain&rsquo;s methods post-sale:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raw chicken turns customers off, so we play it safe and fry at lower temperatures for a longer time than the colonel likes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is fair, but this plays to my theory on scaling businesses.</p>
<p>When you run a small or micro business, a single storefront, or perhaps a business like Britt and I do with <a href="https://withers.co/elopementcollective">The Elopement Collective</a>, or our <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/664131985860711112?source_impression_id=p3_1691652644_ReS5ilVa35tdg7qv">Airbnb</a>, or my <a href="https://withers.co/celebrant">celebrancy practice</a>. Businesses that are anti-scale can celebrate the JOMO of business, the joy of missing out. We can&rsquo;t do every elopement, or every wedding, or take every Airbnb booking on the Gold Coast.</p>
<p>Because of our very deliberate JOMO we can chose a different direction for our businesses where we aim to be five our of five stars, or whatever rating system is in play, we just aim to be the best.</p>
<p><a href="https://cabel.com/about/">Cabel</a> Sasser once <a href="https://twitter.com/cabel/status/1195045257835999232">tweeted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can’t help but feel there’s a wonderful and often unexplored middle ground between “die” and “grow and grow aggressively”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And ever since I read that I&rsquo;ve been fascinated on that <em>unexplored middle ground</em>.</p>
<p>When you decide to scale you very simply decide not to be the best, but instead to be the biggest, the cheapest, the most-available, and you turn your back on the best.</p>
<p>I remember a small hotel we stayed at in Manhattan once and it proudly boasted a 7.2 rating on one of the hotel review websites which rated hotels out of 10.</p>
<p>If one of our businesses was 72% as good as the best of that category of businesses we&rsquo;d shut it down, or completely rework it until it was a really good business and bringing immense value to people.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re just one of the thousands of hotels in New York, maybe 7.2 is ok?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not ok for me and it wasn&rsquo;t ok for the Colonel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A New Zealand supermarket experimenting with using AI to generate meal plans has seen its app produce some unusual dishes – recommending customers recipes for deadly chlorine gas, “poison bread sandwiches” and mosquito-repellent roast potatoes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The app, created by supermarket chain Pak ‘n’ Save, was advertised as a way for customers to creatively use up leftovers during the cost of living crisis. It asks users to enter in various ingredients in their homes, and auto-generates a meal plan or recipe, along with cheery commentary. It initially drew attention on social media for some unappealing recipes, including an “oreo vegetable stir-fry”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;re in the beautiful age of quality assurance in large language models. The giveaway is that the supermarket responds with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(we are) disappointed to see “a small minority have tried to use the tool inappropriately and not for its intended purpose</p>

<p>Instead of owning the issue and revealing that the whole thing is built on a house of cards and we&rsquo;re all just figuring this crap out.</p>

			 <p>Why do airlines communicate a flight&rsquo;s departure time instead of a &ldquo;be at the gate&rdquo; time? Every airport and every airline has different timings and many of us live in flight anxiety because of the lack of information.</p>
<p>Is there a good technical reason why departure time is communicated but not gate-deadline time?</p>

			 <p>The PR-wing of the commercial radio community in Australia is getting everyone excited about a new <a href="https://www.commercialradio.com.au/RA/media/General/Documents/CRA-Deloitte-Connecting-Communities-2023-Report.pdf?ext=.pdf">report</a> - that they commissioned and is weirdly in their favour - about how commercial radio in Australia is turning 100 years old this year on November 23rd.</p>
<p>The report tells a compelling story, which I don&rsquo;t consider to be the actuality of local and regional commercial radio in Australia.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A few takeaways from the report include:</p>
<ul>
<li>About three hours of locally significant content per day is broadcast in regional communities - which is pretty much just obeying the law.</li>
<li>74% of Australians surveyed answered &ldquo;sure, why not&rdquo; when asked if they think commercial radio and audio build a sense of community.</li>
<li>Over 1/3 of the jobs in commercial radio are in about 1/3 of Australian society (that being, regional Australia).</li>
</ul>
<p>And it was on the jobs issue I wanted to rebut the argument that Australian radio is &ldquo;booming&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It might be easy to try and point out that anyone born in the last 40 years doesn&rsquo;t know what the antenna on their car is for, or how the Australian commercial radio industry has very poorly stepped foot into podcasting and internet distribution, especially in regards to local and regional content, one of the biggest voids in the sphere of content available today.</p>
<p>But instead I&rsquo;ll share a personal story that might tell you how booming commercial radio is in regional Australia.</p>
<hr>
<p>Late 2009 I accepted a role that I was so unqualified for that it was a joke. Twenty-seven years old, with only volunteer broadcast radio experience on my resume, having only even stepped foot in Western Australia once before at the other end of the state in Broome, let alone the small town of Esperance found on the far western side of the Great Australian Bight on Australia&rsquo;s southern coast, 720 kilometres from the most remote city in the world, a forty hour nonstop drive from home.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The population of over 13,000 people had just shrunk a wee bit after the shock closure of the Ravensthorpe nickel mine in January of that year, but on a freezing cold Saturday morning this young buck who could not name song by The Travelling Wilburys found himself on the corner of Andrew and Demspter Street sitting at an outside broadcast studio in sub-zero temperatures (possibly).</p>
<p>I fell in love with the town of Esperance and its small population. It was a crime that I didn&rsquo;t know who the Wilburys were considering one of its members had <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/local/photos/2012/10/31/3622669.htm">holidayed</a> there, and it was a shame that 14 years on I appreciate the then Radiowest, now Triple M, playlist a lot more than that 27 year old did.</p>
<p>I moved on from that station to Star FM Port Macquarie just over a year later with many great friendships and a much more robust understanding of how to be a leading voice of a local community.</p>
<p>I bring up this anecdote because through COVID things were rough in the wedding industry and Britt and I considered changing many things in our life. One possibility was moving somewhere regional and quiet, somewhere far away, somewhere like Esperance and when the job advert for my old job as breakfast radio host popped up I got in touch. I loved the town and would have cherished the seachange, now with two daughters and now married to the girl I wrote letters to the last time I lived there.</p>
<p>Thirteen years on, with the Esperance population slowly growing, with industry slowly building, and the possibility for remote work in Australia slowly increasing thanks to the NBN and Starlink I thought things might be a little brighter for a modern family moving to the Great Southeast of WA.</p>
<ul>
<li>The cost of goods has increased 36% since I last worked in Esperance. If you paid $60,000 for something in 2009 you were paying $86,000 for it now.</li>
<li>The average wage locally in Esperance (according to the ABS - <a href="https://abs.gov.au/census/find-census-data/quickstats/2021/LGA53290">2021</a> to <a href="https://abs.gov.au/census/find-census-data/quickstats/2006/LGA53290">2006</a>) has increased 65% over (about) the same time period.</li>
<li>The cost of renting has actually doubled.</li>
<li>Esperance-Goldfields property purchase prices have increased about 13%.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the wage on offer for the same job had decreased 7% and was most likely in a smaller team even though it was only a local staff of seven for two radio stations (I was the sole local programming hire) when I was there in 2009. There was the possibility of increasing the wage by also doing radio advertising sales but I&rsquo;ve proven in the past that an advertising salesperson I am not.</p>
<p>The same role, for a slightly larger audience which would be begging for local stories and content in an ever-globalised content world, was paying $938 a week after tax - $177 more than the minimum wage.</p>
<hr>
<p>The premise I&rsquo;m making here is that the very heartbeat of commercial radio is creating a compelling story for an audience and inserting as many ads around that as possible. The fact that a community so bereft of local stories, news, and media personalities cannot support a good wage for someone to fill that role speaks to the weaknesses in the local media market, and the unwillingness of the corporation operating the media to invest there.</p>
<p>I remember a time at Radiowest Esperance where the technology that connects the telephone line to the broadcast console - which was already the simplest of radio technologies, old and very very simple - broke down and there was real deliberation as to whether it should be replaced. I posited the question: are we planning on taking phone calls and broadcasting phone calls and interviews on the radio station in the future? Were phone calls being broadcasted important to the job? I believed they were, but at all levels of management they weren&rsquo;t sure it was worth it.</p>
<p><em>A 2009 era iPhone panorama photo of the low-tech Esperance studio</em>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Maybe Esperance was never going to be a profitable radio station, and if so, hand the broadcast license over to a community radio organisation and let the community run it, like they do the fire and ambulance services.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/359/2023/f929cb0c-83d8-4e56-8e20-46036a31a587.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Talking about the Esperance community spirit, we raised thousands (I think it was about $20,000) for the Perth Children&rsquo;s Hospital when businesses could push their boss off the Tanker Jetty into the subzero Southern Ocean winter waters if they raised or donated $1000. If any community was going to excel at a community radio station it would be Esperance.</p>
<hr>
<p>If a national commercial radio network can&rsquo;t afford to pay a local content creator more than $177 a week over the minimum Australian wage to create and broadcast about 24 hours a week of local content by themselves without local assistance, then I cannot believe that commercial radio is <a href="https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/media/commercial-radio-stations-are-soaring-in-popularity-new-report-shows/news-story/7290c37796eb3a78778073aed15a8bd8">soaring in popularity</a>, or even breaking even financially as a business. Instead, commercial radio in Australia sounds like an industry that has ignored advances in civilisation, in communication, in broadcasting, and how societies work in 2023 and is just hanging on by the threads of people who haven&rsquo;t got CarPlay yet.</p>
<hr>
<p>Rest in peace, commercial radio. You were my first love, but at one hundred years old maybe it&rsquo;s time to pass the batten to someone who understands how to be an integral part of a community.</p>

<p>When you drive many kilometres past beautiful sunflower fields in Tuscany full of big and ripe sunflowers ready to be in a florist&rsquo;s shop window, five days later when you go back to photograph them they&rsquo;ll be harvested and in shop windows.</p>

<p>Sunflowers follow the sun, so when you go out to shoot them at sunrise, they&rsquo;re all looking down like they&rsquo;ve been listening to Nothing Compares 2 U on repeat since they found out about Sinead.</p>

<p>Contemporary America simply isn’t set up to promote mutuality, care, or common life. Rather, it is designed to maximize individual accomplishment as defined by professional and financial success. Such a system leaves precious little time or energy for forms of community that don’t contribute to one’s own professional life or, as one ages, the professional prospects of one’s children. Workism reigns in America, and because of it, community in America, religious community included, is a math problem that doesn’t add up.</p>

			 <p>I love my email. Not because I love my email but because due to the swings and round-a-bouts of modern life needing email, and because writers and publications I want to hear from send emails, I&rsquo;ve figured out how to have an email account that I love. Which according to my friend Steven, isn&rsquo;t possible. Perhaps it is not dissimilar to training a demon to do the housework.</p>
<p>But one day, I can only hope I am so unimportant, so unneeded, so unplugged from the swings and the round-a-bouts, that I can profess what <a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/email.html">Don Knuth wrote in the nineties</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have been a happy man ever since January 1, 1990, when I no longer had an email address.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His very-90s blog post is seemingly popular for advocating that the hyphen be dropped from e-mail, but I am so inspired to reach the stage of life that Knuth quotes in the post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>`I don&rsquo;t even have an e-mail address. I have reached an age where my main purpose is not to receive messages.&rsquo; – Umberto Eco, quoted in the New Yorker</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A former boss told me that as you become more important in a job you start getting more keys, and you seemingly start on a path to have so many keys. Keys to the front door, back door, your office, someone else&rsquo;s office, the stationary cupboard, the storage room, etc etc.</p>
<p>But then you reach a stage in that job where you are so important that you start handing keys back, and all of a sudden you have no keys.</p>
<p>Being that important sounds lovely, but I&rsquo;m more excited about being in such a position that my importance in the world is not an ongoing concern. Instead, my friendship, my love, my efforts would be so valuable to my friends and family that none of us would be measuring importance - or likes, views, follows, or subscriptions - but that we would be in that beautiful utopia of just being a friend.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2023-07-mastodon-distributed-decentralised-fediverse-activitypub">The BBC has embraced ActivityPub</a>, nice work <a href="https://micro.blog/BBCRD@social.bbc">@BBCRD@social.bbc</a>! I&rsquo;ve always thought that the long term advantage from a commercial and brand point of view is to be able to say &ldquo;follow us&rdquo; and the words that follow are your own brand and your own network.</p>
<p>The power of Mastodon, ActivityPub, the Fediverse, means that the BBC can be on Mastodon, and someone else can be on a completely different platform that supports ActivityPub (like <a href="https://help.instagram.com/169559812696339">Threads</a> or <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> for example) and you can follow them. For example this very blog, because it&rsquo;s hosted on Micro.blog means you can follow @hello@joshwithers.blog on your favourite ActivityPub service, like Mastodon, Threads/Tumblr/Flickr one day soon, Pixelfed, or maybe even X if Leon gets his head right, and you can read the blog there. Even <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/">WordPress has an official ActivityPub plugin</a> now!</p>
<p>In fact I could imagine that sometime in the future there&rsquo;ll be a new service that perhaps is more suited to a broadcaster like the BBC and they can transition from Mastodon to it, yet the social graph remains.</p>
<p>When brands and companies operate their own Fediverse instances you can get the updates from your electricity company, you can follow your celebrity or known-person-that-is-a-cool-person and they all get to control their brand and their experience. Instead of mess like <a href="https://mastodon-uk.net/@BBCNewsUK">this</a> and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@bbc#.">this</a>.</p>
<p>They are not at Twitter&rsquo;s, X&rsquo;s, Meta&rsquo;s, Google&rsquo;s or my mercy.</p>
<p>They also are not at the whim of a verification service that is either a secret black box experience, or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/26/23808331/twitter-x-ads-advertising-incentives-verification-brands">thousands of dollars a month</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;re using social.bbc as the domain, so you can be sure these accounts are genuinely from the BBC.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the social media future I&rsquo;d like to see. Where following someone or something is as simple as sending and receiving email.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a large, high profile, public service organisation, we&rsquo;ve had to work through a fair number of issues to get this far and we’ve had advice and support from several teams across the BBC.
Explaining the federated model can be a challenge as people are much more familiar with the centralised model of ownership. We’ve had to answer questions like “Are we running our own social network?” (well, we’re kind of hosting a small section of a social network) and “Are we hosting a user’s content?” (well, we don’t allow users to create accounts or post from our server, but they can reply to our posts from their own servers, and then their posts will appear next to ours and then they might be stored on our server and it all gets quite complicated).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does ActivityPub and the Fediverse have issues? Yes. Should that stop us from moving forward and trying to figure it all out? No.</p>

			 <p>Shane Parrish on fs.blog with, <a href="https://fs.blog/mental-model-hanlons-razor/">Hanlon’s Razor: Not Everyone is Out to Get You</a>, is such an encouraging read today. I was only thinking about how we more often than not think that everyone is looking at us as I was on a beach in Puglia yesterday considering very quickly stripping out of my swimmers into dry pants. I almost did until Britt suggested that everyone would see me. I still wonder whether they would have, and I think not. Most people don&rsquo;t notice me, don&rsquo;t see me, and don&rsquo;t know me. Even less read this blog.</p>
<p>What is Hanlon&rsquo;s Razor you may ask?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by neglect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fs.blog article stretches the razor out to some real world artefacts:</p>
<p>The media:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Modern media treats outrage as a profitable commodity. This often takes the form of articles which often attribute to malice that which could be easily be explained by incompetence or ignorance.</p>

			 <p>About 20 years ago, somewhere early 2003 from memory, I learned the most important lesson I&rsquo;d ever been taught in broadcasting and business, from Stan Hillard:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(When you&rsquo;re broadcasting) imagine the audience are the stupidest people alive, but treat them with the upmost respect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s an axiom employee daily. Assuming the audience doesn&rsquo;t know the backstory, they don&rsquo;t know your reasoning or motivation, or they simply haven&rsquo;t been listening. It&rsquo;s about inclusivity, with the upmost respect for them.</p>
<p>On a side note, in trying to find where Stan was at today, <a href="https://radiotoday.com.au/community-radio-should-be-cut-off/">I stumbled across this piece I wrote for Radio Today ten years ago</a>. Looking back it feels rude at the time but still true today.</p>

			 <p>Leaving Puglia today and I’m struck by the thought, after having experienced about thirty different international communities and societies over the last year that there is an opportunity cost to every society.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve left every community thinking &ldquo;this was great, but &hellip;&rdquo; identifying trade-offs and compromises made to build that society.</p>
<p>Like Puglia for example, I love it here, but there&rsquo;s no breakfast culture. In fact most of the world doesn&rsquo;t celebrate breakfast like Australians do, and weirdly enough that&rsquo;s possibly important to me.</p>
<p>Perhaps utopia is impossible because it would simply be the longest list of compromises ever made? Perhaps getting a good breakfast means you have to live in a society where everyone bottles their feelings and pretends to be polite in traffic, as opposed to Italy where you find out how the driver feels straight away but they won&rsquo;t road rage you?</p>
<p>Is that the price I want to pay for eggs Benedict and a long black with cream?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s when a movement to improve certain social conditions, whether it&rsquo;s about race, gender, or whatever else, turns from an active effort into a rigid ideology, then you have a problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ian originally wrote about wokeness in <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2023/07/protestant-ethic-and-the-spirit-of-wokeness/">Harpers Magazine</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Writing about “Woke” has at least two pitfalls. One is that any criticism of its excesses provokes accusations of racism, xenophobia, transphobia, misogyny, or white supremacy. The other problem is the word itself, which has been a term of abuse employed by the far right, a battle cry for the progressive left, and an embarrassment to many liberals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking forward to a future where being woke is a clearer idea and status. I&rsquo;m sick of wondering if I&rsquo;m a sheeple or a wolk folk, and by who&rsquo;s definition.</p>

			 <p>Amanda Holpuch in the New York Times in June 2023:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>South Koreans became a year or two younger on Wednesday after a law standardizing the way the government counts age took effect.
There are three common ways to count age in South Korea, but the government has changed its civil code to recognise one: starting from zero on a person’s date of birth and adding a year at each birthday.
This is the age-counting method used most often around the world, but it is a departure from the country’s most popular method, often called “Korean age.” Under that system, a person is considered 1 year old at birth, and a year is added to their age each Jan. 1. This meant that an infant born on Dec. 31 was considered 2 years old the next day.</p>

			 <p>Uluṟu, that beautiful monolith that captures the very essence of Australia. It&rsquo;s my favourite place in Australia. This iconic natural wonder is far more than an awe-inspiring spectacle - it represents the rich tapestry of indigenous heritage and gathering for ceremony.</p>
<p>Uluṟu is intrinsically linked with the indigenous Anangu people, serving as an embodiment of their Tjukurpa - a term that captures the moral laws, spirituality, and existence of these people. Uluṟu&rsquo;s formation stems from a time of ancestral beings, the Dreamtime, whose stories are etched across its vast surface in the form of petroglyphs.</p>
<p>For countless generations, Uluṟu has been a significant ceremonial site, bearing witness to rites of passage and important celebrations. This land, imprinted with the songs and dances of the Anangu, has been a part of their life&rsquo;s tapestry, from birth to death and every joy and hardship in between.</p>
<p>Now, imagine breathing your marriage into life here - a site resonating with tales of love, life, and dreams, where the deep-red soil has observed centuries of human connection. A marriage ceremony at Uluṟu represents a union not only between two individuals but also a communion with our shared human legacy and the ancient rhythms of this remarkable landscape.</p>
<p>As a wedding celebrant, my commitment at Uluṟu is to ensure that your ceremony encapsulates your story while honouring the deep-seated heritage there. In doing so, we pay tribute to the traditional custodians of this land.</p>
<p>Joining the long line of stories woven into this sacred land, adding our mark to the generations of human experiences that Uluṟu has borne witness to.</p>

<p>The English, said Sir John Fortescue (c. 1470), &ldquo;drink no water, unless at certain times upon religious score, or by way of doing penance.&rdquo;, looking at reconstructions of beer consumption from the middle ages to the pre-industrial era this was only a slight exaggeration. When estimating consumption from the amount of beer provided to soldiers, convicts, and workers or reconstructing consumption from tax revenues on beer we see that the average person consumed about a liter of beer a day, this is around four times as much as consumption in modern beer-drinking countries.</p>

			 <p>Reflecting on <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/07/26/matt-mullenweg-on.html">Matt Mullenweg ten years ago reflecting on Steve Jobs/Apple&rsquo;s courage to release products</a>, I&rsquo;ve been on an early morning walk down memory lane - perhaps because I woke very early and the kids are still asleep - thinking about my first few weeks with a drone camera, the original DJI Mavic Pro. It was delivered on the 28th of April 2017. I was fresh off a red eye flight from a Perth wedding the day before and straight out the door to a Tenterfield wedding that afternoon. Britt came for the drive and we put the drone up at the Airbnb.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/359/2023/088afc19-7f47-4b0c-9fdd-b1981380c880.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t read a manual, or the civil aviation guides. I just turned it on and thought I&rsquo;d see what it did.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know about aperture (or lack thereof in the original Mavic), ISO, white balance, or shooting in RAW.</p>
<p>I just put it up in the air, mashed my fingers into the remote control, and started creating.</p>
<p>It always has been and always will be not only my first camera, but my favourite camera.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/359/2023/5f03ae56-20f8-496b-b7fb-2af3e0c4f2cb.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve crashed a few drones, thank god for great insurance and DJI Care, lost one into a wave, and another into Queensland’s Great Sandy Bay. I&rsquo;ve even had one fly away in Iceland due to magnetic interference!</p>
<p>Since these early photos - seriously, all a fluke that they&rsquo;re ok photos - I&rsquo;ve been so blessed to have my work experienced by so many. <a href="https://www.pexels.com/@hellojoshwithers/">24 million views on Pexels</a>, <a href="https://unsplash.com/@joshwithers">201 million on Unsplash</a>, commissioned work in a handful of places like the <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2021/04/30/my-first-photography.html">Sydney Reece showroom</a> or the Hilton Gold Coast boardroom, and in a <a href="https://priints.com/products/south-o-talle">gallery in London</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got my own <a href="https://art.josh.withers.co">fine art prints gallery</a> online that&rsquo;s sold about three photos, and the commissions I&rsquo;ve received have probably covered the cost of the drones I&rsquo;ve purchased, but regardless it brings me so much joy.</p>
<p>I hope my photos over the last six years have meant something to you. It makes me smile looking back at these first few photos. I had no idea what I was doing, I was just making.</p>

			 <p>One of my most-used and favourite apps is Flighty, and they&rsquo;ve just <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1358823008">announced a new version</a> that&rsquo;s basically a frequent flyer&rsquo;s private social network. I love it!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Flighty 3.0 is the new way to share your flying with family and friends. Keep track of your loved ones, not flight numbers. Another industry-first from Flighty.</p>
<ol>
<li>Flighty Friends - Connect with family and friends once, then you can see each other trips and get alerts — automatically and ongoing. You’ll see them on your map, can choose alerts levels, and can stop sharing anytime.</li>
<li>Group Trip Ready - Your flights and friend’s flights appear together in the new Today view. Everyone’s live ETA and status make group trips easy.</li>
<li>Friends Names in Flight Alerts - Now with name, photo, and custom controls per person to avoid notification fatigue.</li>
<li>Trip Sharing - Send multiple flights at once. Receivers can add them to Flighty, or simply view them in their browser.</li>
<li>Whose Flight is That? - See who’s on each flight in your flight list, on the map, and including their seat number if you’re sharing a plane.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Add me as a friend on Flighty, yo!</p>
<p>P.S.: Flighty is one of the very few iPhone apps I use on the regular which was quick to allow it&rsquo;s app to be used on Apple silicon Macs, something more developers should consider enabling.</p>

			 <p>In a story on the book &lsquo;Welcome to Sex&rsquo;, Amy Remeikis <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/25/yumi-stynes-big-w-sex-education-book-welcome-to-sex-jess-hill-senate-enquiry">writes in The Guardian</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The response to a sex education and consent book which was removed from the shelves of Big W stores shows how far Australia still has to go on sex education, a Senate committee inquiry has heard.
Welcome to Sex, co-authored by the former Dolly Doctor and adolescent health expert Dr Melissa Kang and feminist writer Yumi Stynes, became the target of an online protest campaign. The book was pulled from shelves at Big W after staff members were abused.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m fairly done with the constant outrage in society today, the idea that we just need to be upset all day every day. It keeps journalists employed and right wing activist social media groups active. But I will say, I don&rsquo;t want Luna or Goldie to stumble across this book in a bookstore without me there to guide them.</p>
<p>I have a theory that the problem with modern Australian society is that continue outsourcing jobs that families, humans, friends and partners should be doing. An example is there&rsquo;s a guy in a Facebook group today hiring people to be friends with disabled kids and it&rsquo;s NDIS funded. We&rsquo;ve outsourced friendship to the Commonwealth. Even in COVID most didn&rsquo;t understand that the reasons for the lockdowns and border closures is because we have outsourced out community wellbeing to the state, so their undertaking of the &lsquo;contract&rsquo; is to minimise expenses.</p>
<p>As it is with this book, it&rsquo;s a vendor looking to win the contract for the outsourcing of your parenting.</p>
<p>My worldview is that there are matters for the home, for the community, for the family, to deal with, fix, entertain, talk about.</p>
<p>An example is my controversial opinion that I don&rsquo;t like abortion. I have no problem with liberal/progressive abortion laws, it&rsquo;s good for it to be regulated and I don&rsquo;t think people are just out there aborting babies like it&rsquo;s a fun pastime, but ultimately - in my utopian vision for the world - I&rsquo;d like to see no abortion. Instead as someone is presented with the crossroads where they would consider an abortion the community would help. If money was required, they&rsquo;d help. If the baby needed parenting, we&rsquo;d help. That there would be a personalised, tailored solution, involving community and family compromise that resulted in the baby being born and being loved. I&rsquo;m aware that my utopia does not exist, but that&rsquo;s just where I&rsquo;d like to see society be. No need to @ me, I know that rape exists, there are medical quandaries, and sex protection doesn&rsquo;t always work, but I&rsquo;d really simply, almost blindly stupidly just love to see babies be born and be loved. It&rsquo;s like a one in 400 billion chance that a baby would ever be born, I just don&rsquo;t want to squander it.</p>
<p>So I have my utopian vision, and it&rsquo;s about communities and families taking it upon themselves to care for and love the ones within. Of course Police and governance has its place, but we should take more responsibility in the home and in the community. If I see someone litter I call them out on it, and if they&rsquo;re not there I pick the rubbish up and put it in the bin, that&rsquo;s me.</p>
<p>So, back to the book.</p>
<p>The main problem I see with the book is that I don&rsquo;t want my girls to pick it up, if I liked the books message, I would bring it to them. But the other problem in the story today is with the linking of the book and consent. It&rsquo;s a long shot. Consent is important, should be deeply known, understood and respected by all people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chanel Contos, the founder of Teach us Consent, echoed those concerns. “Young people are learning about sex from pornography, which – a phrase I always use is that is basically like learning how to drive a car by watching Formula One,” Contos said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If children are learning about sex from pornography - I&rsquo;ll humbly admit that was my early &ldquo;education&rdquo;, not due to my own wants but a severe lack of parental input and presence (thanks mum and dad, didn&rsquo;t mess me up at all) - the answer isn&rsquo;t to put a children&rsquo;s book about sex on shelves. Sure, make it available as a resource to parents who want to engage with that resource when they are ready to, but the gaping hole in Australian society today isn&rsquo;t lack of resource, it&rsquo;s leadership from parents, or as I like to call it: parenting.</p>
<p>Australians are parenting less and less. I can talk about this from my own experience, my mother walked out when I was five, my step-mother didn&rsquo;t really like me, and my father worked often two to three jobs.</p>
<p>A former Channel V host should not have to parent my children, I don&rsquo;t want Woolworths Group to parent my children, I want close to zero of the community group that identifies as politicians to parent my children, and regardless of education choices anyone makes the educators are not parenting our kids.</p>
<p>Parents need to parent. Families and communities need to step up. Parents are not the kids best mates. Parents are not caregivers or landlords. Parents are leaders, leading their kids from birth to greatness - of course that greatness does include a deep and loving understanding and respect of other people&rsquo;s consent, and also an understanding of the concepts of sex, intercourse, dating, courting, etc.</p>
<p>We have a set of boundaries with our kids that we will not lie to them, we will not lead them astray, but we&rsquo;ll also respect their need to play, rest, and learn at their speed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll let them learn about scissoring when their fragile-because-of-age minds can fully understand what it means. Not when they pick it up off a shelf in a book shop next to Paw Patrol.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I welcome resources like Welcome to Sex being made available as a resource for parents to introduce to children when they deem so, but please make a space in society for parents to parent their children in their own unique way. Don&rsquo;t force our hands. We don&rsquo;t live in a single-speed society. Our lives have a transmission, everyone&rsquo;s driving at different speeds at different revs using different gears, on different roads, needing to operate at different gears. Making a book this graphic and forward available for my child to just to pick up isn&rsquo;t the way.</p>
<p>Create space for parents to lead their children, and maybe they will?</p>

			 <p>I shared this on Facebook six years ago, on July 24, 2017:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Something you probably don&rsquo;t realise when you ask me to be your celebrant is that in celebrating your marriage, you&rsquo;re gleaning a little from mine.
As I prep for your ceremony I&rsquo;m taking notes on you both and your definitions of marriage,m although the foundation of my belief of what marriage is and what it looks like in real life starts at home.
So with that said, I ought share some personal news about our marriage.
For almost five years Britt and I have been trying to fall pregnant, so today we took the next step and our doctor extracted 13 eggs from Britt so we could get some third party assistance in that area.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>How cute is it that while you&rsquo;re under general anaesthetic they scribble the extraction number on your hand like you&rsquo;re tattooing your BFF with a biro in high school.
Life doesn&rsquo;t always go as you plan, that&rsquo;s the beauty of marriage - it&rsquo;s the two of you together forever regardless of how well the plan&rsquo;s going, or not. And because of that union, we know, that the best is yet to come.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Three former employees of The Knot have <a href="https://theknotwhistleblowers.com/">blown thy whitsle</a>. Jennifer Croom Davidson, former Global Fashion Director; Rachel LaFera, former Director of Fine Jewelry; and Cindy Croom Elley, former Account Executive at The Knot, have since left, are out from under NDA, and they&rsquo;re truth-telling about one of the world&rsquo;s largest wedding industry companies: The Knot Worldwide.</p>
<p>The Knot Worldwide is the current name of the parent company of WeddingWire, The Knot, The Bump, Hitched (which formerly had a presence in Australia, and disclosure, yours truly was a paid writer for them), a series of localised wedding directory websites through The Americas and Europe, and the Real Weddings TV show. They started as an AOL channel in 1996 and went to the open web in &lsquo;97, and just before the dot com bubble burst they raised $35 million in their first IPO.</p>
<p>Since then lots of corporate shit has occurred, most of which bores me as someone who prefers to be on the &ldquo;tools&rdquo; in the wedding industry, not in the C-suite, but the trio dropped the bomb on <a href="https://www.lioness.co/post/behind-its-pretty-facade-wedding-site-the-knot-hides-a-dark-side">The Lioness</a> in an extremely detailed expose revealing that advertisers don&rsquo;t get what they&rsquo;re paying for and the whole business is terribly run.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This internal chatter among The Knot Worldwide’s customers is confirmed by looking at currently available web review sites; to this day, you can see complaints of contracts unfulfilled and impossible to get out of, and torrents of fake and spam leads. A recent Business Insider article also reveals that things are still amiss, reporting that 70–80 percent of the company’s leads are scams and that little to no inbound results from their advertising.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://petapixel.com/2023/07/20/the-knot-swindles-advertisers-and-mistreats-workers-ex-employees-say/">PetaPixel sums it up</a> well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whistleblowers within the company say the supposed “swindling” issues began with vendors who purchased premium ads with the promise of generating new client leads, but instead were delivered spam content and even lost rankings within The Knot’s own ad-based search results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/enshittification">enshittification</a> of the internet spares no person and knows no bounds. It is sad to see one of the few companies that made it through the dot com bubble to be revealed as rotten.</p>

W. Singer, recommended by my favourite Cybersecurity Guard, <a href="https://micro.blog/qldnick">@qldnick</a> 📚</p>
<p>It was a compelling and enjoyable read, and honestly, a refreshingly human conclusion that somewhat settles its disturbing and frightening chorus of a society a few years ahead of where we are today struggling with the effects of advancing technology.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Never go into battle with a bot you can’t trust and never trust a bot you don’t know how to snuff out.</p>

<p>The largest truth in this fictional read is that fear always takes the wheel, especially for those who have apparently been listening to the guy who said not to fear.</p>

			 <p>I shared these words from Craig Mod <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/07/19/craig-mod-devastatingly.html">a year ago today</a>. But since then we made the choice to uproot our life in Australia, move to Mexico, then leave Mexico, travel around the USA and Europe for a while, and come home to Australia in a month&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>I can guarantee I&rsquo;m coming home changed, but like Craig, I&rsquo;m also more confused than ever about why some people travel. I mean no judgement towards any of you, but I&rsquo;ve been in Italy for a month now and it seems such a waste to leave in a few weeks. Even considering my feeling that I&rsquo;ve barely seen or experienced anything, I still have a deeply resonating feeling that I&rsquo;m selfishly taking in the culture here, and to do what with it? Just to give the girls a childhood photo album that was cooler than mine?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The romantic ideal of travel is to leave as one version of yourself and return another, changed, ‘better’ version of yourself. This trip changed me, but not in the ways you might classically expect. I’ve returned suspicious of travel, more confused than ever about why so many people travel. Unsure if most travel of the last few decades makes sense, or has ever made sense or justified the cost. It feels like some consumerist, uncurious notion of travel was seeded long ago and, like a zombie fungus, has mind-controlled everyone to four specific canals in Venice. To a single painting at the Louvre. To three streets and a square in Manhattan. To a few rickety back alleys around Gion. An eminently photogenic set of torii in Kyoto.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regardless of my, and Craig&rsquo;s, trepidations of travel being an unjustified expense or impact, I&rsquo;m forever changed by 2020-2022&rsquo;s travel-related traumas and 2023&rsquo;s travel adventure.</p>

			 <p>Just going on the record for everyone who asks where we are, where we’re living now, and if we’re ever coming home to Australia: we’re in Italy then Paris and Singapore between now and getting home to the Gold Coast late August.</p>
<p>I’m back to work and at your service making weddings and elopements from August 22, 2023.</p>
<p>I’ve got travel around Australia and New Zealand for weddings and elopements through the end of this year and early next year before we head back to Europe in 2024.</p>
<p>I’ve also had some requests for the USA if you’re interested in having me there too.</p>
<p>June, July, and August 2024 for <a href="https://withers.co/celebrant">weddings</a> and also elopements with <a href="https://withers.co/elopementcollective">The Elopement Collective</a> and some of our team including <a href="https://www.jasoncorrotophoto.com">Jason Corroto</a>, <a href="https://houseofloveweddings.com">House of Love Weddings</a>, <a href="https://www.georgebowden.co">George Bowden</a>, <a href="https://www.houseoflucie.com">House Of Lucie</a>, and <a href="https://pearcebrennan.co">Pearce Brennan</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, I wanted to address something a few people have lovingly brought to my attention “I thought you only did elopements”.</p>
<p>I might be married to the @elopementcollective’s boss, but I create ceremony for all and sundry. Big weddings, small weddings, elopements, and corporate events as a master of ceremonies. As the band was named, I do weddings, parties, anything.</p>
<p>So very formerly: I do weddings as well. If you know someone getting married somewhere in the world and you reckon we’d be a fit, let them know I exist!</p>

It would have to be a place with the right climate. It would have to be a place that could afford it. It should possess something of an international flavour. It should have a proven track record. It should be located in a democratic country but not a hegemonic one. It should be Vancouver.</p>

			 <p>This week ahead sees the Australian celebrancy movement celebrate its 50th anniversary.</p>
<p>50 years ago 0% of Australian weddings were lead by a civil celebrant, today over 80% are. And the entire movement has driven the Australian wedding industry forward to a point where we lead the world’s wedding industry in product, service, brand, professionalism, and creativity.</p>
<p>For a movement that’s grown from Canberra to the world, thank you Lionel Murphy, Lois D’Arcy, and my celebrant colleagues for making a way for me to make a job that takes me aroundd the world.</p>

			 <p>The most terrifying thing I’ve seen in Italy so far was ten Italian youths aged around 12 years old loudly chanting “gay!” and aggressively geaturing in a way that was a little bit too familiar for this Sarina High School alumni, taunting this young lad who was just laughing in their face!</p>

			 <p>My favourite/least-favourite thing to do when travelling Italy is go to these million year old classical Italian osterias (restaurants) run by the village’s most heralded humans, and ask for takeaway.</p>
<p>The first reaction from the staff is a blank look on their face, as if I’ve just asked them to murder the weakest member of the wait staff.</p>
<p>The second thing they do is ask permission from someone in a back room. I assume it’s the pope.</p>
<p>The third is agree then go searching for takeaway boxes or dishes. I’ve seen them run across the road and get some.</p>
<p>Finally, after all this I’ll ask for a glass of vino “while I wait” and the same thing happens every time. The young wait staff member comes back and explains that they can’t do takeaway glasses of wine.</p>
<p>I just wish I could explain to them that we’re dispassionate about disciplining our two and four year olds in restaurants and the world’s just a nicer place if we takeaway.</p>
<p>But thanks to the magic of Apple Translate and hand gestures we get there in the end.</p>

			 <p>Does anyone else have weird iPhone storage glitches? I&rsquo;ve had this problem for the last maybe 4-5 years where my iPhone doesn&rsquo;t actually know how much storage it has. I&rsquo;ve been on a 256GB iPhone for a while now, and Apple Store staff have asked me to backup and restore, I&rsquo;ve even started on new installs recently.</p>
<p>The only thing that normally fixes it is doing a backup to my Mac.</p>
<p>My gut feeling tells me that there was a time maybe 4-5 years ago where I was loading in RAW images from my camera into iCloud Photo Library and editing with RAW Power and I reckon that they&rsquo;re stuck in the iCloud/phone storage jungle.</p>
<p>My Mac&rsquo;s Photos library also has this weird thing where it picks 1 or 2 photos that it allegedly cannot upload to the cloud, yet it actually originally got that photo from the cloud (it was uploaded on my phone), and the photo is still in the cloud.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m semi-tempted to burn this 20-year-old .mac/MobileMe/iCloud account to the ground, export everything, and start again. It feels like there&rsquo;s always something small that could be buggy happening &hellip; or is that just how iCloud feels for everyone?</p>

			 <p>The most fascinating, whilst also overwhelming, experience in travel, especially when you undertake it for more than a weekend is &rsquo;noticing'.</p>
<p>Almost every time I notice something I think about what Steve Jobs once said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;When you are a stranger in a place, you notice things that you rapidly stop noticing when you become familiar.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I sincerely love being a stranger. I think that&rsquo;s a common thread in my life, that when I become too known I feel uncomfortable. I feel very comfortable being a stranger in a strange place and rather too uncomfortable being at home.</p>
<p>I hope I can give my kids the upbringing that would help them feel the complete opposite, but still curious about the world, still desiring to be strangers in a strange place, noticing.</p>

			 <p>When I first went into self-employment over a decade ago now I set up templates for common or transactional emails and I was always aware that I didn’t want an email not from me, yet from me, to not sound like I had sat down and written the letter.</p>
<p>So I used to write the automated emails from our cat, Stevie.</p>
<p>Stevie is no longer with us, her liver went south, but she lives on as of this week. I’ve replaced all of our automated emails with ChatGPT-generated emails and yet messages written by Stevie AI. Seeing what ChatGPT/Stevie is writing is amazing and hilarious and really good.</p>

			 <p>Why the rush to 5G?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On a per user basis, a 5G network is cheaper to operate than a 4G one. The technology is easier to maintain and more reliable. It’s not sexy. That’s something that is hard to sell to consumers, but makes a huge difference to telcos. There’s much more to this. The additional capacity may not be a pressing matter in New Zealand right now, but in time there will be more connections and 5G gives carriers headroom to cope with future demand. There may be future apps that can use the speed.</p>

<p>We think we can easily see into the hearts of others based on the flimsiest of clues. We jump at the chance to judge strangers. We would never do that to ourselves, of course. We are nuanced and complex and enigmatic. But the stranger is easy.</p>

			 <p>Advice I read recently said &ldquo;Social networks: choose two&rdquo; and I can&rsquo;t drop the feeling that it&rsquo;s quite sage. In the overwhelm and the overbearing influx of social media content and the greater network of services there I&rsquo;ve almost chosen zero instead of two, which isn&rsquo;t any better than the fifteen or so you can choose from today.</p>
<p>I feel like today I live in between the rock of exposure and engagement and the hard place of privacy. I&rsquo;ve moved so far away from Google and Meta properties to avoid the leakage of private data and my contribution to their share price, and moved toward the open web, privacy-respecting social media, and I feel really good about it - but barely anyone else in my network cares. I&rsquo;m still surprised when I see intelligent friends using Twitter as if it&rsquo;s the kind of bar people like us would show our faces.</p>
<p>Seeing the launch of Instagram/Meta&rsquo;s new Twitter doppelganger, Threads, is encouraging this week as the project lead, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/05/adam-mosseri-says-metas-threads-app-wont-have-activitypub-support-at-launch/">Adam Mosseri is seemingly committed to open-web philosophies</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We’re committed to building support for ActivityPub, the protocol behind Mastodon, into this app. We weren’t able to finish it for launch given a number of complications that come along with a decentralized network, but it’s coming. If you’re wondering why this matters, here’s a reason: you may one day end up leaving Threads, or, hopefully not, end up de-platformed. If that ever happens, you should be able to take your audience with you to another server. Being open can enable that.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being open also enables you to &ldquo;choose two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how I currently &ldquo;social media&rdquo; (Spoiler: this is more media and less social):</p>
<p>Anything I want to share with the world starts here on my <a href="https://micro.blog">micro.blog</a>, which serves a few purposes.</p>
<ol>
<li>Firstly it shares my stories with my micro.blog community, and they&rsquo;re a great bunch of people. A good portion of them are people who - like me - backed <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/manton/indie-microblogging-owning-your-short-form-writing">Manton&rsquo;s Kickstarter</a> for the whole idea, and the rest are people who went searching for a cool glass of water in the internet desert.</li>
<li>Secondly, my micro blogs actually post to my own blog, which is hosted by micro.blog but if I ever took issue with the service, the fee, the community, the leadership, or whatever may happen - I can very easily take my content to my own hosting. I could in fact do that today and still remain part of the micro.blog community and use the micro.blog tools. This is the power and the beauty of the open web and decentralised internet services.</li>
<li>Finally, micro.blog pushes my content out to a number of other social networks, with the number always growing. Linkedin, Twitter, Mastodon, Medium, and Bluesky, all social networks that I look active on because of micro.blog.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had broadcasting in my genes for twenty years so that model serves me well. I craft a story, tell the story, and it shares to a few places. Today I&rsquo;ll then get that story and also take it where micro.blog can&rsquo;t (because of lack of API), like Facebook, Instagram, and now Threads.</p>
<p>And on a regular day, that&rsquo;s where it stops. Opening those apps for anything other than broadcasting is such an overwhelming action. I&rsquo;ve unfollowed thousands of people, but it&rsquo;s still too much.</p>
<p>But if I had to pick two today, I&rsquo;d go where I get the most interaction, and that would be the Meta properties and micro.blog. Mastodon, Bluesky. T2, LinkedIn, and Twitter are all graveyards as far as community, for me at least.</p>
<p>I open all the apps on a daily basis and it&rsquo;s just so rare to feel seen or heard in there. I get more feedback and encouragement via emails from <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/subscribe/">subscribers to my weekly blog email</a> or text messages and conversations with people I love. You can <a href="https://tinylytics.app/public/NM2HQsVLhg1zw58uNBug">actually publicly see how many people read my blog</a>, and the odd post breaks out, but mostly it&rsquo;s a group of 10-15 people.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s just the way it&rsquo;s supposed to be? Maybe we&rsquo;re not supposed to be on every single social network in existence? It&rsquo;s just a strange thing for me to come to terms with, the gradual decline from talking to thousands of people a day on the radio, and on stages, through to being on breakfast TV and reality TV, to just being a dad who gets 10 likes on his Facebook post and calls his wife to let her know he&rsquo;s going viral.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in reading more about micro.blog and the wider open web movement, <a href="https://book.micro.blog">Manton Reece&rsquo;s book is great</a>, or at least, will be great when he publishes it and takes it out of draft.</p>
<p>Long live <a href="https://www.threads.net/@hellojoshwithers">Threads</a>, maybe there&rsquo;s a chance for a second breath of Twitter-like-wind there.</p>

			 <p>We&rsquo;ve been in more Airbnb&rsquo;s this last year than most people, about 35 so far I think. Most hosts mention either in person, or in their review, how it&rsquo;s unique to travel with our kids (four and two) and how we don&rsquo;t ask much of them, like how this host mentioned out &ldquo;autonomy&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Should we be more needy? Are we too Australian? Honestly, after driving three to five hours with kids the last thing we want to do is talk to an Airbnb host lol.</p>

			 <p>📚 I&rsquo;ve owned and used a Kindle for over a decade, it had been my favourite gadget for so long. But over the years I started to realise that Amazon wasn&rsquo;t interested in pushing the platform forward any further and the software wasn&rsquo;t going to get any better. I even upgraded to the Amazon Kindle Scribe and it was an embarrassingly bad product. The final straw was when Jean-Louis Gassée&rsquo;s new book, <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9798987047446">Grateful Geek</a> just didn&rsquo;t work on any physical Kindle devices, despite Amazon happily selling me a copy.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://atp.fm">ATP</a> Marco Arment started expressing similar concerns a few weeks/months earlier in 2023 and he did the hard testing and returning work required to convince me to buy a Kobo Libra 2 while I was in Paris in May.</p>
<p>I love this device, it&rsquo;s my new favourite gadget. But &hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>The Kobo store is in a dismal state, and/or, the publishing world is in a dismal state</li>
<li>The eBook publishing world is run by terrible humans who sometimes charge more for an eBook than a printed book, often release the print book weeks or months before an ebook, and just generally don&rsquo;t know how to sell a book to people.</li>
<li>There isn&rsquo;t a competing ebook marketplace outside of Amazon and Kobo.</li>
<li>And there&rsquo;s a chance that the other great feature of Kobo eReaders is going away in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23778208/kobo-pocket-ebook-reader-integration-ending">Pocket integration</a>, that is, unless Kobo updates its software.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I&rsquo;m now left in a weird spot, there are five books I&rsquo;d like to read and buy, but I can&rsquo;t buy them for my Kobo. Will anyone sell me a plain old boring ePub?</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781984881137">Paved Paradise</a> by Henry Grabar</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/">enshitiffication</a> of the world continues and I guess those books will just sit on <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/bookshelf/">my electronic bookshelf</a> waiting for me to figure out how to read them without cutting down another tree or having two ereaders.</p>

			 <p>Over 1000 years old, this sanctuary in Genga&rsquo;s Frasassi Caves was intended to be a refuge from sinners, but when you see it from a sky, it looks like the church itself is seeking refuge from the world.</p>
<p>The temple you now see was complete in 1827 under the suggestion of Pope Leo XII. For all this time it was called the Temple of Valadier but recent study has revealed that Giuseppe Valadier, its namesake architect, didn&rsquo;t design it at all.</p>
<p>Either which way, it&rsquo;s nice to know that Catholic sinners get a cool place to pilgrimage to.</p>
<p>I caught a few moments after the sun set, in between rain clouds, to get the drone up. I&rsquo;d been driving for 45 minutes and gotten stuck down two dead ends. I was making these photos tonight!</p>

			 <p>For the past ten months, my and my family&rsquo;s non-clothing and non-toiletries life has completely lived inside a Think Tank camera bag and it will do so for another 50 days. I took the opportunity this afternoon to do a quick audit, headcount, and make sure everything I was carrying was necessary, and inspired by the <a href="https://hemisphericviews.com">Hemispheric Views podcast</a> segment &lsquo;Rate my desk&rsquo; I thought I would submit my &lsquo;desk away from home&rsquo; to the internets.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll guess a few of the questions &ldquo;What is that?!&rdquo;:</p>
<ul>
<li>Panic Playdate</li>
<li>photocopies of passports and actual passports</li>
<li>parfum</li>
<li>new and identical backup sunglasses because the last place you want to be is in a strange new land without your favourite sunglasses</li>
<li>octopus straps, you never know when you&rsquo;ll need to strap something to something (same goes for the tape)</li>
<li>USB-C dock with an ethernet port, because sometimes you just need to plug the damn thing in to get internet</li>
<li>my eldest daughter&rsquo;s camera (Nikon Coolpix childproof <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ79NMpqpJs">potato camera</a>)</li>
<li>my wife&rsquo;s camera (Fuji X-S10 with a 27mm)</li>

			 <p>As a family we travel with a MacBook Pro, iPad mini, two iPhones, Apple Watch, and a series of things that require either USB-A, USB-C, or micro USB to charge. We’ve chosen gadgets and utilities that are all USB-C, with exceptions where necessary.</p>
<p>My DJI Magic 3 drone batteries need 65W but my current travel charger’s 65W apparently doesn’t quite meet the needs the DJI three-battery USB-C charger, so the 96W Apple original MBP charger does the MacBook and the drone batteries.</p>
<p>For a family of four travelling globally for a year it was hard to figure out the exact right kit, but we got there in the end.</p>
<p>So my worldwide travel solution has been</p>
<ul>
<li>two Anker 543 Chargers (65W II), these have two USB-A ports, a USB-C 45W port and a USB-C 20W port</li>
<li>my original 96W MacBook charger.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these, including the MacBook charger, takes as an input the figure 8 lead. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_60320">Figure 8 leads, or IEC C7</a> leads as they’re technically known, are very easy to procure locally, most Airbnb’s even have multiple devices already using them, they’re inexpensive, and they’re small to carry.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So I buy three IEC C7 leads for each region we’re travelling to. If we weren’t on a year long trip I’d hold onto the leads but suitcase space is at a premium. So far I’ve needed four different leads, a set for Australia, Mexico/USA, then the European kind, and finally the best of all - the British variety. The Brits don’t get much right but they figured out electrical points and plugs really well.</p>
<p>I also have this assortment of cables</p>
<ul>
<li>4x Thunderbolt 4/USB-C cables about 25cm long. These suit most charging, data, plugging-in situations.</li>
<li>USB-C lightning leads for the iPhones</li>
<li>the Apple MagSafe travel dock for Watch and iPhone</li>
<li>and the get out of jail free card is my USB-A to Lightning + USB-C + Micro-USB three-headed plug.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s how we travel the globe keeping everything charged and no stress.</p>

			 <p>Tim Cook once said that &ldquo;we are high on AR for the long run&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s true, for 28 years Apple - and the rest of the tech industry - has been noodling around on augmented reality and virtual reality.</p>
<p>Out of a purely personal interest, I started flipping through rumours about Apple and its &ldquo;glasses&rdquo; to see where the leakers got it right and wrong, and the next minute I&rsquo;m back in 1995, so I thought a curated list of all the leaks, rumours, and related dates might be a nice record to make in the year of our headset, AVP 0.</p>

<p>Such a display would convincingly create the illusion of objects with arbitrary optical properties. A metallic object depicted using the display would reflect the visual surroundings of the display. Dielectric materials would show correct refraction and reflection effects. Light shone on the display would illuminate the virtual objects within it. When programmed to depict empty space, the display would, for all practical purposes, disappear, rendering the contained volume invisible. Incremental steps towards such a device are discussed.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been playing around with 360 content for over seven years ago now and I have a few questions about where Apple is going to take the format.</p>
<p>If you make 360 content today, you spend a lot of time looking at content like this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It&rsquo;s not as appealing as the embeds below.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve recorded my work <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km8SXtRWAsg">creating marriage ceremonies in 360 video</a>, and with my various DJI drones, I&rsquo;ve been trying to create 360 still content as well.</p>
<p>My question and thought for today is how will the new spatial computing frontier handle consumer stills and video in 360? Will Apple standardise the media, and let it be viewed in Preview or Quick Look?</p>
<p>Will other devices be able to make content for the Apple Vision, will Apple Vision 3D or 360 content be viewable and enjoyed on other platforms?</p>
<p>How should content creators prepare for this new content-style? Is this permission to buy new gear?!!? (Please let my wife know if so).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been bullish on 360 for over seven years, I&rsquo;m excited to see where it goes.</p>

			 <p>I’m back baby!</p>
<p>Listening to an investor on a podcast today reminded me of how and why I do what I do. He was talking about advice that he had been given regarding his investment portfolio, and the person giving the advice said how well does that pie chart of what you’ve invested in reflect or match your interests, talents, and skills? The advice being that you should invest in what you know, invest in what you are passionate about.</p>
<p>So, after a solid sabbatical that has taken us through Mexico, the United States of America, and so much of Europe, I am proud to say that we’re coming back to Australia in August and I’m coming back to work as a celebrant.</p>
<p>It’s been a wild couple of years where I didn’t know if I’d ever want to create weddings anymore, but it turns out I just needed a few months off and some quality time with my girls.</p>
<p>I say all of that, to say this. There&rsquo;s a book, and a principle, called the proximity principle, and it&rsquo;s a simple principle. The idea is that the people that are around you, the people that are your community, are the people most likely to be able to help you.</p>
<p>So there are two things I would love some help with. Number one, when we get home we have to buy some cars, and buying a car today is terrible. If you or someone you know is selling your car, let a brother know. Secondly, we&rsquo;re coming back to work and my calendar is wide open. So if you know someone getting married, anywhere in the world, let them know that your mate Josh is a pretty good celebrant.</p>
<p>Normally I’d say I’m looking forward to catching up with you when I’m home for a beer, but it turns - and I’ve researched this extensively on myself during this sabbatical - that beers make me fat and bloated and sick.</p>
<p>So instead I’m looking forward to an old-fashioned or red wine when I’m home.</p>
<p>See you soon!</p>

			 <p>I have a confession to make.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps">The Alps</a>&rdquo; were a thing. I thought people referred to &ldquo;the alps&rdquo; when they referred to alpine areas.</p>
<p>This probably explains why I nerded out pretty hard when I got to the Alps and kept on typing the alps and all my computing devices would autocorrect to The Alps.</p>

<p>I thought it was a cute story and something others might enjoy.</p>
<p>Three hours later I&rsquo;ve had Midjourney make illustrations, assembled the book - very roughly - in the &lsquo;Kindle Kids Book Creator&rsquo;, and it&rsquo;s now submitted to the Amazon Kindle store.</p>
<p>You can see the ChatGPT prompts <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/902065ad-1c78-4505-8df5-bb88f3c6bfeb">here</a> and download <a href="https://let.josh.show/The-Mountain-Princess">the .mobi file here</a>.

			 <p>One of my childhood happy memories was receiving gifts from my Aunty Tracey who lived in Lichtenstein. She was always sending Liechtenstein paraphernalia and propaganda and I was here for it.</p>
<p>For over 30 years I’ve kept this magical vision in my mind of what the richest country per capita on earth would look like.</p>
<p>How safe could a country with no defence force feel? How do you even get to a country that has no airport? How small can the smallest country to win an Olympic medal be? How beautiful could the only country on earth to be completely in the alps be?</p>
<p>Today I got some answers.</p>

<p>The two furthest-away boundaries of the entire nation are 25km apart!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Some of the most interesting Lichtenstein facts I know:</p>
<ol>
<li>Liechtenstein is one of the smallest countries in the world, both in terms of land area and population. It covers just 160 square kilometres, about the physical size of Geelong, with a population of just over 39,000, about the same population as the town of Orange in New South Wales.</li>
<li>It is one of only two countries in the world that are &ldquo;double landlocked&rdquo;, which means they are landlocked by countries that are also landlocked. The other is Uzbekistan.</li>
<li>Despite its small size, Liechtenstein is one of the wealthiest countries in the world per capita. The Prince of Lichtenstein, the head bloke, makes $40 mil a month off his own investments and businesses, he doesn&rsquo;t take a wage or anything like that.</li>
<li>Liechtenstein is the world’s largest exporter of false teeth, specifically for dentures. This is due to the presence of Ivoclar Vivadent, a company that leads the world in false teeth manufacturing. The country is also home to Hilti the construction tools company.</li>
<li>Liechtenstein doesn&rsquo;t have its own airport or railway system. The nearest airport is in Zurich, Switzerland. For rail, it is served by the Swiss railways.</li>
<li>Liechtenstein is a principality, governed by a constitutional monarch who holds expansive powers, including the ability to veto legislation. It is the last remaining monarchy in the Holy Roman Empire.</li>
<li>Liechtenstein had the highest gross domestic product (GDP) per person in the world, when adjusted by purchasing power parity.</li>
<li>The entire country is invited to the castle of the Prince of Liechtenstein for beer and pretzels on National Day (August 15).</li>
<li>Despite being an independent country, Liechtenstein uses the Swiss Franc as its official currency.</li>
<li>Liechtenstein has one of the lowest crime rates in the world. It has even been reported that the country&rsquo;s citizens often don’t lock their doors.</li>
<li>Liechtenstein disbanded its army in 1868 because it was too costly. In fact, Switzerland has been responsible for its defence since 1923. The CIA World Factbook for many years incorrectly stated it had a defence budget of $12. It&rsquo;s actually closer to zero.</li>
<li>The country’s capital, Vaduz, and the region of the Alps, has been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site for its stunning alpine beauty.</li>
<li>Liechtenstein is known for its excellent wines. The Prince of Liechtenstein Winery, owned by the princely family, is one of the most famous wineries. I drank one of his beers today and it&rsquo;s equally delicious.</li>
<li>Despite its location in Central Europe, Liechtenstein managed to remain neutral and was untouched during both World War I and World War II.</li>
<li>There are more businesses registered in Lichtenstein than residents, so most of the residents work in support of these businesses, or in tourism, dentistry, or working for Hilti making tools.</li>

			 <p>I vividly remember all of my earliest computer experiences. I remember borrowing computer magazines from the school library that contained basic code, and then taking it to the Apple IIe in the back of my classroom. I would spend hours typing in code just to run another program. I also remember building a spreadsheet to help my dad run his business, and printing our own greeting cards with personalised messages on our black-and-white, dot matrix printer.</p>

<p>Even back in the 90s, there was talk of this coming artificial intelligence wave. Funnily enough, my entire experience from the very first day was about artificial intelligence. The simple fact that I could press the letter &lsquo;a&rsquo; on a plastic keyboard and then see that letter appear on the computer screen in front of me, or even get printed out by a printer, was, in my humble opinion, a form of artificial intelligence. This might be an oversimplified view, but whether it&rsquo;s displaying the letter &lsquo;a&rsquo; on a computer screen or using ChatGPT, it&rsquo;s all about computers computing.</p>
<p>In 1999, Bill Gates published a book called &lsquo;<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_@_the_Speed_of_Thought">Business @ the Speed of Thought</a>&rsquo;. I read it maybe a year later, and the foundational principles of &ldquo;using computers for a real purpose&rdquo; have stuck with me ever since. One idea was that a sandwich shop could use just-in-time ordering for sandwich ingredients based on previous order histories for different days of the week, taking into account seasons, weather, and trends - a task that a computer in 1999 could perform with some effort, but a task a computer in 2023 could handle effortlessly. This resonates with <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2011/12/21/steve-jobs-bicycle-for-the-mind-1990/">Steve Jobs&rsquo;s idea that computers are like bicycles for the mind</a>, an idea based on the fact that the fastest and most productive animal on the planet is not a human, but a human on a bicycle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think one of the things that really separates us from the high primates is that we&rsquo;re tool builders. I read a study that measured the efficiency of locomotion for various species on the planet. The condor used the least energy to move a kilometer. And, humans came in with a rather unimpressive showing, about a third of the way down the list. It was not too proud a showing for the crown of creation. So, that didn&rsquo;t look so good. But, then somebody at Scientific American had the insight to test the efficiency of locomotion for a man on a bicycle. And, a man on a bicycle, a human on a bicycle, blew the condor away, completely off the top of the charts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This simple principle - that humans are more efficient on a bike, and that the human mind is more efficient when using a computer - has proven true in my life every day for the last 30 years.</p>
<p>Quickly replying to enquiry emails on my iPhone from a toilet cubicle at my last job before becoming self-employed was a key factor in my early success.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my encouragement to anyone skeptical about the 2023 &ldquo;AI wave&rdquo;, including ChatGPT, large language models, transformer models, AI, generative art, etc. It&rsquo;s just what computing is now. Embrace it and exploit it to your benefit. Whether it&rsquo;s for play or for work, use these technologies to not only stay ahead of the pack, but to keep up with the pack.</p>
<p>A fellow wedding celebrant argued on a post of mine about AI that anyone using this technology should be de-registered. My counter-argument is that any celebrant (or entrepreneur) not using this technology will self de-register within a few years, sinking into irrelevance and inefficiency due to their refusal to adapt.</p>
<h3 id="ais-right-of-reply">AI’s right of reply</h3>
<p>As an AI developed by OpenAI, I&rsquo;d like to add that I&rsquo;m designed to assist and augment human capabilities rather than replace them. In the case of a wedding celebrant, for example, I could help with tasks such as drafting vows or organizing schedules. The idea isn&rsquo;t to detract from the human element, but rather to enhance it, freeing up time for more personal interactions.</p>
<p>The notion of de-registering those who use AI perhaps stems from a fear of being replaced or a misunderstanding of AI&rsquo;s role. AIs are tools, much like computers or smartphones, meant to assist humans in various tasks and should be seen as such. Adopting AI and other technological advancements can lead to increased efficiency and enable people to adapt to the fast-paced world we live in. It&rsquo;s about integrating technology into our lives and work in a way that benefits us all.</p>

			 <p>Driving across Austria this week we&rsquo;ve seen plenty of castles, we even stayed in one, and every sighting of one is pretty special.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There&rsquo;s one near us which looks very much like a castle, and tonight on our last night in Hopfgarten I found out the history of the castle on <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/castle-itter">Atlas Obscura</a> and it&rsquo;s the most interesting of stories:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the final weeks of the European theater of World War II, an unexpected union of German and American forces guarded a select group of abandoned Nazi prisoners against the Waffen-SS. The conflict fought by this unique joint American-German alliance is frequently referred to as the strangest battle of World War II.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Castle Itter was first built in the ninth century by the Bavarians and spent many years as a private residence. In May of 1943, after the Anschluss of Austria, it was transformed into a prison. For two years, French captives considered to be of high value were confined within its walls.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But as Stephen Harding writes in The Last Battle, those prisoners eventually found themselves unguarded and thrust into a precarious position. Days after Hitler died by suicide, it became clear the war had reached a turning point. The commander and warden of the prisoners at Castle Itter abandoned their posts, knowing the end of the war was near. The remaining guards also fled, essentially giving the castle to those imprisoned within.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This left the prisoners vulnerable to the loyal Waffen-SS troops prowling the countryside in search of deserters and enemies of the regime. This is when the strange, unlikely union of German and American forces began. Kurt-Siegfried Schrader, a highly decorated SS Hauptsturmführer and Josef “Sep” Gangl, a Wehrmacht Major, joined Captain John “Jack” Carey Lee, Jr., an American Tank Company Commander, in protecting the prisoners and defending the castle.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Schrader and Gangl had become disillusioned with the Nazi ideology and both independently connected with the Austrian resistance. Upon hearing the prisoners at the castle were unguarded, Schrader went to the fortress to protect those held inside. Gangl, now serving as the head of the local resistance, was aware the forces under his command would not be strong enough to fight against the nearby Waffen-SS troops. He realized he needed the American forces to arrive, so he set off to find them in Kufstein.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Not long after arriving in Kufstein, Gangl met up with Lee and they began plotting. After a reconnaissance mission, Lee and his friend brought their Sherman Tanks to the defend the castle. But along the way, poor infrastructure caused one tank and its crew to be left behind.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Once at the castle, Wehrmacht soldiers and the few Americans prepared for battle. The prisoners were instructed to remain safely in the cellar, but many defied these orders and fought alongside the German and American troops. The stage was now set for the fight.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Between 100 and 150 Waffen-SS troops attacked the castle in the early morning hours of May 5. Though one Wehrmacht soldier abandoned his post during the fighting, the remaining American-German defenses held the prison until more American troops from the 142nd Infantry Regiment arrived 12 hours after the fighting had begun. With the help of the additional American troops, the guards defeated the Waffen-SS in what’s viewed the last battle fought in the European theater of World War II. Gangl sadly perished during the fight.</p>

<p>You know what’s funny about our time in Austria is that I knew nothing about the country a few weeks ago, my main exposure being when I would be in America or Mexico, introducing myself a an Australian and they’d think I said Austrian and make some stupid comments about how they have always wanted to visit Europe. But thanks to a tip from a friend who recommended renting a car in Vienna because it’s cheaper than Italy, we’re exploring Austria and loving it!</p>

			<h1><a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/06/14/travelling-with-children.html">Travelling with children advice</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/06/14/travelling-with-children.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-06-15 00:02:38 &#43;1000">Jun 15, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I was asked recently about advice for travelling with young children.</p>
<p>My family including our now 4.5 and 2 year olds, left home almost a year ago and I have this advice: after about 37 accomodations and eight countries.</p>
<ul>
<li>Travel light. Lighter than you think. Bring as little stuff as possible.</li>
<li>Lots of snacks. More than you think you need.</li>
<li>Make iPad/TV shows a special treat. Fish out the special treat when necessary for sanity or social goodwill like in a line, stuck in a train or plane cabin, or a restaurant.</li>
<li>Discipline your kids lovingly, positively, and well in private so they are awesome humans when in public.</li>
<li>Teach your kids to be bored and look out the window.</li>
<li>Figure out what kind of daily sleep/wake/activity routine or schedule works best for your kids and run with it so that all of you have a good day and you&rsquo;re not dragging your kids through a hike they were never going to enjoy.</li>
<li>Expect to see and do far less things than you imagined. If we do one travel or touristy thing a day that&rsquo;s a win. Two is a big day. Three is a mistake.</li>
<li>When in lines at immigration or other important things, and they’re really unhappy, just grin and bare it. It’s a few minutes of everyone’s life, we’ll all be fine, and all the other assholes around you have been expecting the tantrum anyway. If people look at us or comment on a tantrum, I just joke about it like “sorry, she just learned about taxes” or “sorry, this is my first abduction and it’s not really going well.”</li>
<li>Teach your kids their names, ages, and your names so that when police come for you after you make a joke about abductions you can prove they’re yours. Make sure they know not to joke about who their parents are and what their names are.</li>
<li>Bring extra dummies/soothers.</li>
<li>We swear by the Phil &amp; Ted&rsquo;s Travel Cot version 5. Not sponsored. We&rsquo;ve tried the rest, the Bugaboo is awesome, Phil &amp; Ted&rsquo;s is better.</li>
<li>We also swear by the BabyZen YoYo and/or the Baby Jogger City Tour travel prams. The rest are not as good. Not sponsored. But come on guys, send us money.</li>
<li>When boarding flights ask the staff where to &ldquo;put the kids&rdquo; as if you&rsquo;re expecting them to not sit with you. Say it with a straight face, and kind of hold the child out toward the staff, gesturing that they can take them now.</li>
<li>Book accomodation that is walkable to public transport and parks. Nothing else in your life matters more than a good playground. Also look for accomodation with cooking facilities, you&rsquo;re going to want to cook at home.</li>
<li>Whatever you order for them at a restaurant will not be good enough so share meals. Encourage them to try new foods. Our mantra is that you can&rsquo;t say you don&rsquo;t like something if you haven&rsquo;t tried it yet.</li>
<li>Almost all long queues can be skipped if you are a family, or if you accidentally go down the not-foreign-passport line, or if your kids has a tantrum. Turn that lemon into line-skipping lemonade.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve got VLC installed on my phone with a series of old school TV shows offline like Franklin the Turtle. Old school slow TV shows are better than the visual cocaine that modern kids shows are. Damn you, Paw Patrol.</li>
<li>Take a million photos. Sync them with iCloud Photo Library so when you drop your phone in the Mediterranean Sea you&rsquo;re not devastated. Buy disposable film cameras for the kids to make them feel involved.</li>
<li>Each of our girls has a plush snuggle toy that has come with them the whole journey. When you&rsquo;re changing accomodation every few days a common smell and feel is a godsend.</li>
<li>I’m lucky to have travelled so much with Qantas that I have a Qantas Platinum status which gets us more luggage and airport lounges with OneWorld airlines worldwide, this is so good with kids. Everyone in the Oneworld First Class Lounge thinks they’re having a fancy aviation with champagne moment but then in runs my two year old ready to bring hell. It’s my favourite part of every flight.</li>
<li>Snacks. Water. Lots of snacks.</li>
<li>My kids like to play with tape so we have random coloured kid’s sticky tape for them to play with on flights. The water-painting kits for kids are awesome, they come with a water “brush” and it reacts with the board, so they think they’re painting but it’s zero mess apart from some water. So many books as well, we’ll buy, read, and donate books regularly.</li>
<li>Sleep. So much sleep.</li>
<li>There’s no greater experience than allowing your kids to sulk in different cultural settings.</li>
<li>I use the Anker 4-port chargers and buy the figure 8 lead for the appropriate country, then make sure everything we own is USB chargeable.</li>
</ul>
<p>These experiences and memories will be priceless. Be in the moment for them all.</p>

<p>But they are filled with the most wonderful little Austrian villages, like Pöggstall.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I imagine it would feel rather nice to be proud of the part of your story that you didn&rsquo;t really have any choice in. The country you were born in, the state, the region. The people group you were raised in. Parents and the generations that preceded you, your family, your heritage, your culture.</p>
<p>I imagine that if you were so blessed to be of good stock, then you&rsquo;d probably be delicate and defensive when that story comes under fire - whether it&rsquo;s comedy or outright slander.</p>
<p>I imagine that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve upset friends and lost social media klout this week after joking about the UK and how it didn&rsquo;t meet the hype, in my ever so humble opinion.</p>
<p>Friends and strangers let me know how they felt about it, and it honestly left me stunned. But as I watched the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace yesterday it all fell into place for me. These people, Brits, people who like the Brits, people who love London and the UK, all this pomp and bullshit from the royals to the status quo is an essential part of their story. It&rsquo;s who they are this external force of nature.</p>
<p>You dare make a joke about London, and you&rsquo;re attacking their identity.</p>
<p>I see myself as blessed because I know exactly who I am. I&rsquo;m the Gold Coast born, Central Queensland raised white boy born with colonial blood, entering the world not into the lands of my people but someone else&rsquo;s land. Born of convict blood, sent from England to the stolen land down under generations ago. I&rsquo;m the abandoned son, a homeless teen, who got by the only way available to him, working.</p>
<p>My birthplace, my country, my people, they don&rsquo;t know me. There is a small group of friends and family who stand with me, but we could fill a minivan. If I was to die tomorrow my funeral would be a lovely occasion for the small group attending. They&rsquo;re a good lot.</p>
<p>But my culture, my family, my tribe is a single generation old, my generation. With my wife I have drawn a line in the sand and said it ends with me. Britt and I, we&rsquo;re starting new.</p>
<p>I also know how few people read my words or see my art. I&rsquo;m no Shakespeare or Monet.</p>
<p>I have nothing to be precious of but my wife and children, my work, my words and my art, my relationships and my reputation.</p>
<p>Make a funny joke about them and I&rsquo;d probably push back hard as well.</p>

			 <p>London is a fascinating place where Big Tea™️ has convinced an entire population that garbage water is a valid hot drink.</p>
<p>Everyone speaks in a cute and fake-sounding British accent, whilst real people actually travel on the public transport which accepts the Apple Express Transit Card feature.</p>
<p>AirBnbs are priced like Paris but unlike Paris, London is in England, which is far less fancy than France. Here, they drive on the left side of the road but walk on the right side of the path, and there’s this forced politeness in the air like if you’re not polite you’ll get stabbed. Who knew Jack The Ripper could have left such a lasting impression on culture.</p>
<p>The people are quite proud of their flag, so much so that I could definitely imagine them sailing to other countries and giving them free British flags in exchange for the rights to the whole country.</p>
<p>Despite their global shirt-fronting and general we-think-we’re-cool dispositions, the people of London either commute longer than they actually work, or they live impoverished and close to the famed series of Tubes, spending their final quids on beer or denying that Europe is a cool place.</p>
<p>Brits have influenced more culture in my life than I’d care to admit, but I’m still not sure it’s better than their penal colony I call home.</p>
<p>Long live King Chuck, God knows the bunting and signage stockists and manufacturers couldn’t handle the demand for at least another few years.</p>

			 <p>AI is genuinely exciting and terrifying but most of us nerds have been thinking about it and talking about it for 30 years.</p>
<p>This is Steve Jobs in 1983:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;when the next Aristotle comes around, maybe if he carries around one of these machines with him his whole life—his or her whole life—and types in all this stuff, then maybe someday, after this person’s dead and gone, we can ask this machine, “Hey, what would Aristotle have said? What about this?” And maybe we won’t get the right answer, but maybe we will. And that’s really exciting to me. And that’s one of the reasons I’m doing what I’m doing.</p>

			 <p>Sitting in a park in Paris watching my kids play I was struck by the idea that at age 41, married for almost 11 years, with two children, that I&rsquo;m possibly an adult now.</p>
<p>Which probably sounds weird to anyone familiar with the concept of becoming an adult in our society somewhere between puberty and 21.</p>
<p>But I think we lack something in modern society - I know I lacked it in my childhood - that would not only help the 41 year old so know that they&rsquo;re adults but also help all of us take ownership of our lives. Help us understand that you can either make your life or let someone or something else make it for you. Help us take responsibility for our lives, our families, and our futures.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ceremony.</p>
<p>We shy away from it, not wanting to celebrate birthdays or anniversaries in public, or for some of us we even deny our age. We minimise weddings and engagements saying we don&rsquo;t want to be the centre of attention - and this is even worse in Australia where tall poppy syndrome rears its ugly head stopping us from celebrating our achievements in life. I even hear it from people who, when they find out I&rsquo;m a wedding celebrant, proudly tell me how they just went to the registry office and didn&rsquo;t have a wedding.</p>
<p>For hundreds of generations we have celebrated milestones and achievements with ceremony and feasting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how we know where we have been, where we are, and where we&rsquo;re going.</p>
<p>I believe ceremony is important. It&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m a marriage celebrant.</p>
<p>Good ceremony is where we stop, collaborate, and listen. A moment for us to speak truths, smile, laugh, draw near, and share.</p>
<p>I hope you find the time to stop and celebrate something this week.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/05/12/apple-shortcut-for.html">Apple Shortcut for recording photography metadata</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/05/12/apple-shortcut-for.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-05-12 18:14:51 &#43;1000">May 12, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;m passionate about making photos, but I have a sub-passion in recording good metadata around those photos as they enter my iCloud Photo Library so the photos become more useful as they age. Whether they are used in Photo Memories, like &ldquo;Paris 2023&rdquo; and &ldquo;Early Mornings with Luna&rdquo;, or whether I want to search on the Photo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Places&rdquo; function to find that photo I made ten years ago, the metadata is important to me.</p>
<p>When I shoot on my iPhone, the metadata is collected (normally), and if I have remembered to force quit and re-open the Canon Camera Connect app that day, when I shoot on my Canon EOS R5 the metadata is recorded, but if I shoot on Britt&rsquo;s Fujifilm digital camera or my Leica film camera, no metadata is recorded by the camera.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=The+Before+Time">before time</a>s people used <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com">notepads</a> with pens, which is a lovely prospect, but I have an iPhone in my pocket and a Watch on my wrist. So I made an Apple Shortcut that will record the metadata in time and in place for later use, either with an EXIF editor or my personal go-to app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id914457352">Metapho</a> on the iPhone. (If you know of a Metapho competitor I&rsquo;d be keen to hear it, I like Metapho but it feels forgotten by the developer and is sometimes buggy)</p>
<p>So these shortcuts will simply make a new Apple Note for the day if there isn&rsquo;t one already and record time and place, or if you use the second shortcut that dictates a note, also that text note.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/6c46abfb32c84714b99939e17f7c4bd2">Record photography location and notes Shortcut</a></p>
<p>I activate them either by tapping the home screen icon which is easy, or by asking Siri to &ldquo;Record photography location&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Feel free to use, edit, mix, re-make, and share as you find useful and beneficial for the art of making photography.</p>
<p>Much gratitude to <a href="https://talk.automators.fm/t/a-shortcut-to-record-photography-metadata-as-youre-shooting/15727">Kyle Lines in the Automators Forum</a> for helping me get the shortcuts over the line and useful for the greater population.</p>

			 <p>I stumbled across and subsequently visited an <a href="https://nftfactoryparis.com">NFT art gallery</a> in Paris today whilst walking the streets with Luna and trying to escape the rain. The art curated inside was wild and beautiful, and a joy to take in, but I also had the opportunity to talk to the curator who shared openly about their business model and passion for showcasing, sharing, and encouraging art.</p>
<p>They typically curate the pieces showcased but they have open weeks where creators can buy a spot on the wall, and other weeks creators can rent the whole gallery.</p>
<p>I’m still trying to figure out how <a href="https://art.josh.withers.co">my art</a> works and matters in the world - besides giving it away for free on <a href="https://unsplash.com/@joshwithers">Unsplash</a> and <a href="https://www.pexels.com/@hellojoshwithers/">Pexels</a> - but after visiting the gallery today I’m convinced that NFTs will have life and purpose long after the cryptobros move their hype engine somewhere else.</p>
<p>I even <a href="https://rainbow.me/0xC2F78D865FC4D179e74E61b92eA9233d5a61408d?family=indigo-x-evelyn-o&amp;nft=0x40d69e63129c3524dc7e7abcbf401fc35668f998_3">picked up a piece</a> that Luna loved.</p>
<p>It would be amazing to see my photos on a wall like that.</p>

			 <p>My favourite thing to do in the big cities of the world is to ignore the must-do lists, the must-see places, the hotspots and the icons, and to just walk around and exist in a different big city. Walking down random streets, getting bad coffee at little-known cafes, and finding the unseen parts of a city.
The towers, cathedrals, arches and museums are cool and we inevitably end up there.
But there’s something really interesting to me about experiencing another people’s normal.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this story from Steve Jobs, recalled in 1996 and told in the new book <a href="https://book.stevejobsarchive.com"><em>Make Something Wonderful</em></a>, about how and why he and Steve Wozniak started Apple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason we (Woz and I) built a computer was that we wanted one, and we couldn’t afford to buy one. They were thousands of dollars at that time. We were just two teenagers. We started trying to build them and scrounging parts around Silicon Valley where we could. After a few attempts, we managed to put together something that was the Apple I. All of our friends wanted them, too. They wanted to build them. It turned out that it took maybe fifty hours to build one of these things by hand. It was taking up all of our spare time because our friends were not that skilled at building them, so Woz and I were building them for them.</p>
<p>We thought if we could just get what’s called a printed circuit board, where you could just plug in the parts instead of having to hand-wire the whole thing, we could cut the assembly time down from maybe fifty hours to more like an hour. Woz sold his HP calculator, and I sold my VW Microbus, and we got enough money together to pay someone to design one of these printed circuit boards for us. Our goal was to just sell them as raw printed circuit boards to our friends and make enough money to recoup our calculator and transportation.</p>
<p>What happened was that one of the early computer stores, in fact, the first computer store in the world, which was in Mountain View at the time, said, “Well, I’ll take fifty of these computers, but I want them fully assembled.” Which was a twist that we’d never thought of.</p>
<p>We went and bought the parts to build one hundred computers. We built fifty of them and delivered them. We got paid in cash and ran back and paid the people that sold us parts. Then we had the classic Marxian profit realization crisis, which was our profit wasn’t liquid—it was in fifty computers sitting on the floor.</p>
<p>We decided we had to start learning about sales and distribution so that we could sell the fifty computers and get back our money. That’s how we got in the business. We took our idea (for the computer) to a few companies, one where Woz worked (Hewlett-Packard) and one where I worked at the time (Atari). Neither one was interested in pursuing it, so we started our own company.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m interviewing newly appointed marriage celebrants for a podcast project at the moment and some don&rsquo;t have a fire in their belly as to why they started. Their genesis story is missing some heart and soul. I think about them and whether they have staying power like the two Steves who just built computers because they wanted one. That early fire is valuable.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/05/08/my-review-and.html">My review and photos of the TWA Hotel at JFK Airport</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/05/08/my-review-and.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-05-08 22:58:19 &#43;1000">May 8, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Let me spin you a yarn about my favourite airport hotel, the TWA Hotel at JFK Airport in New York. This hotel is a real beauty, with a great story behind it.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, in the golden era of air travel, TWA - Trans World Airlines - was a big shot in the aviation world. Their Flight Center at JFK Airport, designed by the legendary architect Eero Saarinen, was the bee&rsquo;s knees when it opened in 1962. It was a true symbol of the Jet Age, with its swooping lines, massive windows, and ultra-modern interiors. But, like so much technology - particularly aviation technology - it was practically obsolete by the time it opened with the Lockheed Constellation it was planned to accommodate being swiftly replaced by jetliners. TWA sadly went belly up in January 2001 and was acquired by American Airlines, who then made most of the staff redundant later that year as September 11 left a dent in the air travel market.</p>
<p>For years the iconic TWA Flight Center sat empty, gathering dust and waiting for someone to give it a new lease on life. Enter MCR Development, who had the idea to turn the old bird into a swanky hotel. So, in 2018 they restored the Flight Center to its former glory and added two hotel wings with 512 guest rooms.</p>
<h2 id="the-building">The building</h2>
<p>Eero Saarinen is one of the great architects of the twentieth century and although the TWA Hotel is a little different to the TWA Flight Center Saarinen designed, it&rsquo;s still got the Eero blood running through its entire fuselage.</p>

<h2 id="connie">Connie</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fully restored 1958 Lockheed Constellation aeroplane called &ldquo;Connie&rdquo; that&rsquo;s been repurposed as a cocktail lounge, where you can sip on a cold one and dream about the good ol&rsquo; days. The original Flight Centre was designed to serve Constellations but as quickly as TWA put them into service and the terminal started putting passengers aboard jet planes started replacing them.</p>
<p>The Connie was a plane at the right place but at the wrong time.</p>

<h2 id="the-pool">The pool</h2>
<p>The rooftop pool at the hotel is a major attraction, firstly because it&rsquo;s a pool at JFK, secondly because of the view, thirdly because on cold days it&rsquo;s heated like a jacuzzi, and finally because you can sip a cocktail in a jacuzzi warm pool with your kids watching Emirates Airbus A380s land and taxi so close that you could throw a stone at the captain.</p>

<h2 id="the-actual-hotel-stay">The actual hotel stay</h2>
<p>Our inbound flight to JFK from San Diego arrived at 7am, and we had a midnight flight out to Paris, so we booked an 8am to 8pm day rate that cost $249 USD which at the time was cheaper than overnight, and cheaper than two overnights which is what we&rsquo;d need to book at a regular hotel to allow for an 8am to 8pm stay.</p>
<p>The food was actually really good. We generally don&rsquo;t dine at airport hotel restaurants because their quality is usually poor and the price high, because they know they have you cornered. The Paris Cafe food however was really really good.</p>
<p>The front-of-house service however was poor. The housekeeping staff were beyond friendly and lovely, but the people at reception and front of the house in food and beverage service really made us feel like we&rsquo;d ruined their day.</p>
<p>So, there you have it, the story and photos of the TWA Hotel at JFK Airport. It&rsquo;s a testament to the spirit of innovation and the importance of preserving the USA&rsquo;s architectural gems. If you&rsquo;re ever in the Big Apple, it&rsquo;s worth checking out this iconic piece of American aviation history.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been reminiscing over Twitter this week, wondering <a href="https://twitter.com/JoshuaWithers/status/1604356662042705920?s=20">what the last tweet will be</a> amongst other things as Space Karen <a href="https://twitter.com/verified/status/1648764138452299778">prepares to take away the verification tick on my profile</a> that proves I am who I am, a tick gifted to me from my time in the media in Australia.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I started my <a href="https://twitter.com/joshuawithers">current Twitter account in October 2009</a> but I was sure that I had an account before then so I went searching and searching and searching and found it: <a href="https://twitter.com/1073brekky">March 2008, @1073brekky</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In 2008 I scored my first paid breakfast radio gig: the morning show on 107.3 FM on the Gold Coast (at the time called 1073fm but now called Juice FM). I&rsquo;d been training and prepping for this role for five years and was so keen. I was also a bread-and-butter kind of computer nerd, so ideally my non-nerdy radio show would have some nerdy elements. In 2008 the breakfast guy didn&rsquo;t get access to the website - they probably still don&rsquo;t today - so I wanted to find a way to post short updates to the website. Something inside of me felt like the internet might be a thing one day so it would be good to use it early. I&rsquo;ve got so many stories about being the nerdiest and most future-thinking guy in the radio station that it broke my heart so many times to be honest.</p>
<p>I had heard things about this service in the USA called Twitter that had heralded a new kind of web publishing, micro-blogging. You could send updates to the service and they could appear in a website widget. I <a href="https://twitter.com/1073brekky">signed up</a>, got the code to the web developer and before you know it, I could post updates to my show website! I didn&rsquo;t care so much for the Tweeting, the replying, or the broadcasting. I just wanted to blog on my radio station website and the CRM didn&rsquo;t allow blogging or micro-blogging or anything of the like.</p>
<p>Twitter solved my problem and I&rsquo;m sure my problem was never in any of their minimum-viable product meetings.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>About two months later I quit the station because at the time it was honestly a terrible place a human with a soul could want to work, but fifteen years on I only have good memories from my first breakfast show, my first Twitter account, and my experiences being unleashed on the Gold Coast community on the radio.</p>

<p>When I think about being Christ-like, I think of Bob.</p>
<p>Many publicly-known priests and ministers are loved by church leadership whilst being in the news for scandal and crime, while Bob was hated by church leadership whilst in the news for loving the outcasts of society.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather die a man lambasted by church leaders and known as a friend to outcasts, the downtrodden, the forgotten, the least of our society. That&rsquo;s who Bob was.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I have a theory: today in 2023, we have a Batman because terrorists flew airplanes into the World Trade Centre towers in New York City, a.k.a Gotham City.</p>
<p>My premise is that timing of My Chemical  Romance’s Welcome To The Black Parade’s release influenced Robert Pattison’s Batman at an influential age and made him the Bruce Wayne portrayed in the 2022 film, The Batman.</p>
<p>The 2022 Batman was born in 1991 or 1992, making him “<a href="https://screenrant.com/the-batman-how-old-is-robert-pattinsons-bruce-wayne/">about 30</a>” when the movie was released.</p>
<p><a href="https://screenrant.com/the-batman-wayne-parents-murder-killer-identity-explained/">The Batman’s parents died in 2001</a> (possibly 2002), the year that terrorists flew into the World Trade Towers and changed the world forever. One such change being that <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Chemical_Romance#History">Gerard Way formed the band My Chemical Romance</a> in response to the attacks. The other obvious infliction point here is that the death of Thomas and Martha Wayne is the motivation for young Bruce to become Vengeance personified.</p>
<p>In 2006 when The Batman was about 15 or 16 ‘<a href="https://youtu.be/RRKJiM9Njr8">Welcome To The Black Parade</a>’ was released. Bruce is still rattled by his parent’s murders, growing up a young boy trying to figure out who he is and what his purpose is.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/12/17003076/spotify-data-shows-songs-teens-adult-taste-music">Your teenage years and the music you listen to through those years are formative</a> to who you are and the music you love.</p>
<p>Look at some of My Chemical Romance’s lyrics from the Black Parade:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I was a young boy,
My father took me into the city,
To see a marching band.
He said, &ldquo;Son, when you grow up,
Would you be the savior of the broken,
The beaten and the damned?&rdquo;
He said, &ldquo;Will you defeat them?
Your demons, and all the non-believers,
The plans that they have made?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Because one day, I&rsquo;ll leave you a phantom&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cut to 2022 in film, The Batman</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“They think I am hiding in the shadows, but I am the shadows.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bruce Wayne is the Batman we know in 2022 because of 9/11.</p>

			 <p>I was a media and news man for over a decade, I loved being - what I considered to be - an important part of the community, telling its stories and keeping the community informed, safe, and entertained.</p>
<p>But the industry isn&rsquo;t doing well.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.news.com.au/finance/money/costs/absolutely-insane-young-couples-shocking-story-of-being-nearly-15-million-in-debt-goes-viral/news-story/8631ce792b5102f70e6f8581837d963c">second story on news.com.au</a> today is about a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/young-couples-shocking-story-being-nearly-1-million-debt-goes-viral-absolutely-insane">Fox News story</a> about a recent TikTok that went viral, which the newsdesk found out about through a Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/sportynory/status/1645918001651421184">sharing the TikTok</a> in three parts, and the TikTok was just a replay of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMk7CKwJ8OM">Youtube clip</a> from a radio show four years ago.</p>
<p>Serendipitously the original clip and radio show was broadcast about one kilometre from where I type this in Franklin, Tennessee, but there&rsquo;s no good reason for Australia&rsquo;s national news website - news.com.au - to publish this as a second story today. That the second most important story in Australia today is a four year old viral video is an insult to the wealth of stories Australia has to tell, and the global stories it could engage with.</p>
<p>Yes, it gets the clicks. Yes, it&rsquo;s actually an important story inside the video, be debt free. But from a professional storytelling point of view it&rsquo;s embarrassing for the news.com.au staff. Even the actual article is poorly written and just lazy.</p>
<p>This is the downfall of society, our storytellers are poorly incentivised to do good work, and over incentivised to do work that gets clicks that advertisers want even though no-one is clicking the ads.</p>

			 <p>Six months ago to the day we arrived in Baja California Sur without even knowing that’s what B.C.S. stood for in our hotel’s address as we filled out the entry cards.</p>
<p>Six months on I have a wealth of stories that I feel odd about sharing. Most of them are about how different it is in Mexico compared to Australia. Who knew?! But I can’t find a way to tell the stories without admitting that they were witnessed through my own lens of how the world should be. Paved roads, hot and strong coffee, tacos with proteins other than seafood in them, and the story about the story about George Clooney the bartender told me, all really don’t matter, unless we’re a few whiskies deep around a campfire. It’s different here, not all roads are paved, and gringoes like me have been walking in for years wondering why things here aren’t like home.</p>
<p>The truth is that Mexico is jam-packed with amazing people. We’ve never felt safer and we love it here.</p>
<p>My one takeaway today is that in six months I’ve seen about six clouds. Baja really lived up to its slogan: no bad days.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/03/30/my-first-look.html">My first look at the 400 megapixel mode on the Canon EOS R5</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/03/30/my-first-look.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-03-31 13:22:21 &#43;1000">Mar 31, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;m a sucker for megapixels, because as much as they really don&rsquo;t matter to most people - and they really shouldn&rsquo;t - for me they often mean I&rsquo;ve got room to crop. More pixels collected means more pixels you can delete, a post-production version of digital zoom if you like.</p>
<p>Other, smarter, and different, people will have different reasons for wanting more pixels, so I&rsquo;m not here to pass judgement on the feature, just to share my first thoughts and two images I&rsquo;ve made with the feature.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The feature is actually called IBIS High-resolution shot, apparently, it how it works is that instead of using the stabilisation for stabilising, it uses it to take a bunch of photos whilst moving the sensor, then composes one big image out of it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why shooting handheld isn&rsquo;t a great idea, partially because IBIS (In-Body Image Stabilisation) isn&rsquo;t enabled, and partially because the collection of photos isn&rsquo;t all taken at once, they&rsquo;re taken sequentially.</p>
<p>So as you&rsquo;ll find in my first demo, the palm trees moving in the wind didn&rsquo;t quite make it through to the 400-megapixel image in the best quality.</p>
<p>Below you can download the original raw or jpeg, along with the full-resolution jpegs as exported from Lightroom, plus if you want to play with the files yourself you can remix them in Lightroom online.</p>

<p>Get the <a href="https://www.usa.canon.com/support/p/eos-r5">Canon EOS R5 firmware update to 1.8.1</a> on the Canon website, and reports said you&rsquo;d need to use Canon&rsquo;s EOS Utility to import and read the files. That hasn&rsquo;t been my experience. They&rsquo;re just regular, really big, JPEGs. If you open up the CF or SD card in Finder, it&rsquo;s the same file list, and Lightroom handled them fine, if not a little slowly.</p>

<p>So is it worth it? Let&rsquo;s zoom in. Here&rsquo;s a close-up of the same banana peel scar in the two images.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There was a culture that was encouraged on Tumblr, which was to be able to describe your unique non-normative self. That’s to some extent a feature of modern society anyway. But it was taken to such an extreme that people began to describe this as the “snowflake” (referring to the idea that each snowflake is unique), the person who constructs a totally kind of boutique identity for themselves; then guards that identity in a very, very sensitive way; and reacts in an enraged way when anyone does not respect the uniqueness of their identity. On the other side of the political spectrum, there was the most insensitive culture imaginable: 4chan. The communities involved in gender activism on Tumblr were mostly young progressive women while 4Chan was mostly used by right-leaning young men, so there was an increasingly gendered nature to the online conflict. The two communities supercharged each other with their mutual hatred, as often happens in a culture war. The young identity activists on Tumblr embraced their new notions of identity, fragility and trauma all the more tightly, increasingly saying that words are a form of violence. Meanwhile, the young men on 4Chan moved in the opposite direction; they brandished a rough and rude masculinity in which status was gained by using words more insensitively than the next guy. It was out of this reciprocal dynamic that today’s Cancel Culture was born in the early 2010s. Then, in 2013, it escaped from Tumblr into the much larger Twitterverse. Once on Twitter, it went national and even global (at least within the English-speaking countries), producing the mess we all live with today.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is happiness, anyway? Does anybody know? It’s taken me 80 years to figure out that it’s not a tranquil, sunlit realm at the top of the ladder you’ve spent your whole life hauling yourself up, rung by rung. It’s more like the thing that Christians call grace: you can’t earn it, you can’t strive for it, it’s not a reward for virtue. It exists all right, it will be given to you, but it’s fluid, it’s evasive, it’s out of reach. It’s something you glimpse in the corner of your eye until one day you’re up to your neck in it. And before you’ve had time to take a big gasp and name it, it’s gone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1675, A French merchant named Jacques Savary published The Perfect Merchant, a mercantile manual that came to double as a guide for doing commerce around the world. Albert O. Hirschman cites Savary to explain how capitalism, which would have been regarded as little but avarice as recently as the 16th century, became the sanest ambition of humans in the 17th.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Savary strongly believed that international trade would be the antidote to war. Humans can’t conduct polyglot commerce across borders without cultivating an understanding of foreign laws, customs, and cultures. Savary also believed the Earth’s resources and the fellowship created by commerce were God-given. “It’s not God’s will that all human necessities be found in the same place,” Savary wrote. “Divine Providence has dispersed its gifts so that humans will trade together and find that their mutual need to help each other establishes ties of friendship among them.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First, you need some water. Fuse two hydrogen with one oxygen and repeat until you have enough. While the water is heating, raise some cattle. Pay a man with grim eyes to do the slaughtering, preferably while you are away. Roast the bones, then add to the water. Go away again. Come back once in awhile to skim. When the bones begin to float, lash together into booms and tow up the coast. Reduce. Keep reducing. When you think you have reduced enough, reduce some more. Raise some barley. When the broth coats the back of a spoon and light cannot escape it, you are nearly there. Pause to mop your brow as you harvest the barley. Search in vain for a cloud in the sky. Soak the barley overnight (you will need more water here), then add to the broth. When, out of the blue, you remember the first person you truly loved, the soup is ready. Serve.</p>

			 <p>Three years ago today I had the wildest, wettest day at work so far. Bringing a wedding forward a day, performing the wedding ceremony I already had for that day, then doing the brought-forward ceremony in the rain, rushing back to Sydney Airport from the Blue Mountains, every store is closed in the airport and we catch the fabled last flight into Queensland before they closed the border.</p>
<p>Three years of hell. Here’s to never getting so silly ever again. You can’t stop people from dying, it’s inevitable, but you can stop people from living.</p>

They mixed my order up - bringing a cold americano with hot milk when I ordered the reverse - so my 30 minutes ran out in the middle of a text chat.

			 <p>Flexed my vintage graphic design skills for the local Baja horse sanctuary recently and I’m pretty proud of the work I’ve done.</p>
<p>I used to do web design professionally back in the olden days when computers were stone tablets and Jesus was a boy.</p>
<p>Plus before now you couldn’t find the ranch on Apple or Google Maps properly, and all the search engines and AI chat models didn’t know about them.</p>
<p>Over the coming weeks that will all change as the databases and algorithms catch up.</p>
<p>The horse sanctuary is a registered Mexican charity so they can now take donations online, and they’re on the way to taking horse riding reservations online, selling tickets to events, and also operating as an event venue with online booking etc.</p>
<p>Plus they’ve now got email on their own domain name so they look and feel more professional to donors and grant-giving organisations.</p>
<p>Finally, for the first time in a web design project I got to make all the photography with Britt so we had full creative control of the project.</p>

<p>Literacy literally changes the human brain. The process of learning to read changes our brain, but so does what we read, how we read and on what we read (print, e-reader, phone, laptop). This is especially important in our new reality, when many people are tethered to multiple screens at any given moment.</p>

<p>She also quotes this which really makes me want to throw the TV in the bin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When watching a screen, the infant is bombarded with a stream of fast-paced movements, ongoing blinking lights and scene changes, which require ample cognitive resources to make sense of and process. The brain becomes “overwhelmed” and is unable to leave adequate resources for itself to mature in cognitive skills such as executive functions.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><strong>Update</strong>: <em>July have made good on this error and sent me a replacement bag to where I was in the USA. Thanks for going the extra-mile guys.</em></p>
<p>I feel so heartbroken when I didn&rsquo;t keep my word. I struggle as a parent when I make a promise - or a threat - to my girls because I want to make sure I can follow through on my word. When I fail to keep my word in friendships, family, or business, it pains me. It&rsquo;s why I pore over our website copy and contracts to make sure we can and will do what we promise to do.</p>
<p>So I guess that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m feeling really disappointed in one of my favourite brands: <strong>July</strong>.</p>
<p>Flying from San Jose del Cabo to Brisbane through Los Angeles in November last year a wheel came off my <em>Checked Plus</em> July luggage somewhere between Alaska Airlines&rsquo; check-in at Cabo and the luggage carousel in LAX. I&rsquo;m no fool, I&rsquo;m sure one of the gentle giants working in luggage handling delicately placed the bag where it needed to be and the faulty wheel just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3m5qxZm_JqM">fell off</a>.</p>
<p>I had travel insurance on the trip, and no doubt Alaska Airlines <a href="https://resource.alaskaair.net/-/media/Images/pages/travel-info/baggage/LZ-01-Delayed-Damaged-Bag?v=5">might</a> have covered it - but I know from experience that airlines are painful about damaged luggage.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So I had one week to make the claim with Alaska Airlines, but I thought travel insurance was the sure bet, but I know they&rsquo;d ask me if I&rsquo;d contacted the airline for coverage or the manufacturer for warranty, so I contacted July as I arrived on Australian soil on November 21 - intent to get a quick no from them so I can make an insurance claim, buy a new bag, and be ready to go by the time I leave Australia on December 21. We have one month to solve a hopefully easy problem.</p>
<p>July&rsquo;s &lsquo;Happiness Team&rsquo; replies - and by the way, unless you&rsquo;re actually going to make people happy, just be a customer service or customer disservice team:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We would be happy to have replacement wheels sent out for you.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This I was not expecting!</p>
<p>So I give all the details as required and requested, put to bed any thoughts of wrestling with Alsaka&rsquo;s premiere airline, and even worse, my travel insurance, and await the wheel.</p>
<p>It shipped from July one month later, as I was boarding my flight to Nashville via Sydney and Dallas. I explicitly communicated that I was in the country for a month and it took a month to send the wheel.</p>
<p>Another wheel was then allegedly shipped to my Mexican address but it&rsquo;s been three months and all I am left with now is a series of thoughts and no wheels.</p>
<ul>
<li>going to &ldquo;the media&rdquo; aka social media or the news never works, until it does</li>
<li>I really like the July suitcases and kind of enjoy having a matching set of five despite one limping</li>
<li>we&rsquo;re in Baja California Sur for another month until we go to Nashville and Hawaii then Europe before coming home in August, what am I going to do about this three-wheeled bag.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d really just like another big July bag but do I want to continue to do business with a company that can&rsquo;t simply keep its word?</li>
<li>I wish they&rsquo;d just said no back in November and I would have bought a new bag and they would have never experienced the pain of letting me down.</li>
<li>Can I even get a July bag in, or to, Mexico before April 8?</li>
</ul>

<p>You are a miracle because 86 billion neurons in your brain form into thousands of structures and networks, built from a map created over billions of years to understand the world you live in. But sometimes, you are a pain in your ass because all these networks are running a playbook that’s been around a lot longer than you have. The cells in your body have survived through the eons by eating every delicious calorie they come across, allowing fear to make them run, and using anger to make them fight for their lives.</p>

			 <p>Bryan Jáuregui <a href="https://tosea.net/category/history/">quotes</a> Greg Schredder regarding Rancho Gaspareño, Baja California Sur, just south of Todos Santos, emphasis and photos mine:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>Rancho Gaspareño was named after a Spanish galleon that went aground on the point, the Gaspareño. It was one of the so-called Manila galleons, <strong>Spanish ships that sailed between the Philippines and Acapulco for 250 years</strong>, bringing spices, silks and other luxuries from the far east to New Spain. All <strong>these galleons sailed the Pacific coast of Baja on their way to Acapulco, so naturally enough the area became riddled with pirates</strong>, many of them English and Dutch.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>There are many tales of buried pirate treasure in the area</strong>, and local school groups still come to explore the cave at Rancho Gaspareño each year to tap into the lore. Treasure hunters have reason for optimism; in 1974 when the road from La Paz to the ferry terminal at Pichilingue was being built, a pirate chest of plundered loot was discovered by road workers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I think of this part of the Baja coastline as the forgotten area. People drive past Rancho Gaspareño going a hundred miles an hour on the new 4-lane highway and have no idea of the history of the area.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Guaycura and Pericue Indians were the original inhabitants before the Jesuit’s arrival in 1697, and they were essentially wiped out by the time the Jesuits left in 1768. The Jesuits built their theocracy based on a promise to the King of Spain to get rid of the pirates who were plundering his ships, and the pirates faded away with the demise of the Manila galleons in 1815. Dominican Padre Gabriel González had a ranch near Gaspareño from 1825 to 1850, and the tobacco, rum, sugar, corn, and livestock he produced there made him the richest man in Baja California. <strong>From his ranch the padre engaged in espionage and guerilla warfare during the Mexican-American war of 1846-1848, and – thanks in part to the Padre – Mexico won a major victory near Gaspareño (but lost the war)</strong>. By 1855 the Padre had lost his political backing and left Baja for good. For the next one hundred years entrepreneurs made fortunes in the sugar cane industry with fields in areas like Gaspareño, but in the 1950s a severe drought and price drop lead to the demise of the industry; the last sugar processing plant closed in 1974. In that same year the trans peninsular highway made its way to Todos Santos, bringing new life to the town, and in 1985 renowned artist Charles Stewart arrived from Taos, planting the seed for Todos Santos’ current incarnation as an artists’ colony. It remains an agricultural center and surfing hotspot, only now it is firmly on the radar of major developers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now we all just speed past at 120km/hr on the four-lane highway and wonder <a href="https://theagencyloscabos.com/articles/rancho-gaspareno/">how much</a> the owner wants for it (shhh, <a href="https://www.internationalsurfproperties.com/listing/rancho-gaspareno-oceanfront-development/">$12M</a>).</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>My greatest fear for my kids and for future generations is what it means to create within and around such specific analytics being available.</p>
<p>I (unfortunately) have precise readings of how many people read and view my work. Where they come from and where they don&rsquo;t. How many followers, likes, and shares each social network allows me.</p>
<p>Honestly, it&rsquo;s depressing and it is the biggest impediment to my creative work.</p>
<p>Efforts to remove the signals from my life have been mostly meaningless and sometimes even have adversely affected business, revenue, and our family&rsquo;s supply.</p>
<p>I am most aware of this because my career as a creator started when its audience was measured by handwritten diaries, radio-listening diaries completed at the end of the day where the surveyed people would report on which radio stations they listened to - in quarter-hour blocks - throughout the day, usually reporting at the end of the day. Somehow entire industries and careers like mine were built on the back of less than 0.1% of the population writing in a book for a few weeks a year was representative of the entire local population, and we all took this as gospel.</p>
<p>Now I know exactly that one person watched one of my YouTube videos of me talking about a chapter of my book, and they didn&rsquo;t even finish, and I also know that my silly Instagram Reel of my four-year-old daughter with a wavy video effect has been seen by over 100,000 people.</p>
<p>And even if we think that 100,000 people is a great reach, it&rsquo;s only 0.00125% of the global population. Is 0.001% reach within our content goals this month?</p>
<p>With the slightest margin of error, we can tell you that somewhere between 25 to 35 visit our business website every day, but somehow we make enough bookings to provide for our family.</p>
<p>I think about the New York Times article recently published where I was quoted and our websites linked to, and it looks like pretty much zero of the article&rsquo;s readers clicked those links. I wonder how many people actually read the article which had taken many hours of at least one journalist&rsquo;s and one editor&rsquo;s time to research, write, and publish. The most promotion I witnessed of the article itself was a small text link at the bottom of the NY Times front page. Do people read that far down? Do they click those links? Did anyone even read that article?</p>
<p>Things aren&rsquo;t bad, but there was a mysterious time only recently when you could broadcast a radio program and have no idea how many people heard it. You could print a newspaper, and obviously, you would have some idea of how many papers were printed, but who read which articles? You never knew! It was beautiful. You could write an article you thought was worth writing, that the editor thought was worth publishing, and you would just send it off to the printer along with the headline news about that scandal and the other story about how politicians are terrible.</p>
<p>Do we still create beautiful things if we believe that no one will see them?</p>
<p>George Berkeley wrote in A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The objects of sense exist only when they are perceived; the trees therefore are in the garden&hellip; no longer than while there is somebody by to perceive them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you suppose that no one might perceive your creation, do you even create it in the first place?</p>
<p>Are we ok with being unpopular? Are our kids ok with it?</p>
<p>If you asked me I&rsquo;d say I am ok with it, if only because it&rsquo;s my reality. But the truth is that this reality also affects my ability to create. I second-guess myself, wondering if it&rsquo;s even worth clicking the shutter button or opening up the laptop to write a chapter of a book that will most likely be purchased by only my close friends and read by even fewer.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;ve published this piece, and added a featured image of me trying to figure out why Morgan&rsquo;s Nikon camera wasn&rsquo;t working (if you know, you know) I&rsquo;ve realised that all of these thoughts of mine are before and almost exclusionary of artificial intelligence and large language models.</p>
<p>Creating really is doomed isn&rsquo;t it &hellip;</p>

			 <p>Steven Pressfield on going deep:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone wants to succeed immediately and without pain or effort. Or they love to write books about how to write books, rather than actually writing a book that might actually be about something. Bad advice is everywhere. Build a following. Establish a platform. Learn how to scam the system. In other words, do all the surface stuff and none of the real work it takes to actually produce something of value. The disease of our times is that we live on the surface. We&rsquo;re like the Platte River, a mile wide and an inch deep. Real work and real satisfaction come from the opposite of what the web provides. They come from going deep into something - the book you&rsquo;re writing, the album, the movie -and staying there for a long, long time.</p>

			 <p>Mexico City’s zoo is free to access, and weirdly, equal parts cool and scary. I’m Australia animal enclosures are 1) large and spacious, and 2) very, very, very securely separate from humans. It’s very hard for humans to touch or be close to animals.</p>
<p>But at Zoológico de Chapultepec I could very much just jump into the lion’s area.</p>
<p>Every day in Mexico I’m confronted with the stark difference between Australia’s “let’s assume you’re stupid, we’ll try and stop you from dying” modus operandi to Mexico’s “let’s assume you’re smart, we’re not going to try and stop you dying”, which honestly, from an intellectual point of view really appeals to me.</p>

			 <p>Every day I experience another “Mexico moment” and I am hesitant to share them publicly because I don’t want to ruin things here, nor be a stupid gringo. But today was great.</p>
<p>We bought a car back in October but it hasn’t been registered to me yet because to register a car you need a drivers license and to get a drivers license you need residency plus proof of address and a blood test.</p>
<p>Proof of residence is hard because addresses aren’t really a thing in regional Mexico so you use electricity bills and most electricity bills are in the name of a corporation because individuals can’t own properties.</p>
<p>So I find out last week I can get a letter of residence instead of using an electricity bill.</p>
<p>It takes me like four different government offices to find the right person in a back office of an office that is full of young people talking and laughing and this lady agrees to help. We’re talking the back office of the back office of a building without a sign near the building I thought I had to go to.</p>
<p>I need this important letter and she drafts it up, spells my name wrong, we correct it, and then the big boss of the department needs to sign it. By big boss I mean “President of the Municipality”.</p>
<p>He’s busy talking to important people.</p>
<p>She sits there for like three minutes clearly thinking it all through and then she just forges his signature, smiles at me, and hands me the letter.</p>
<p>I get a blood test from a local doctor and I’m now a licensed Mexican driver.</p>
<p>Policy and procedure means everything and nothing over here.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a miracle because 86 billion neurons in your brain form into thousands of structures and networks, built from a map created over billions of years to understand the world you live in. But sometimes, you are a pain in your ass because all these networks are running a playbook that’s been around a lot longer than you have. The cells in your body have survived through the eons by eating every delicious calorie they come across, allowing fear to make them run, and using anger to make them fight for their lives.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>From <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780310358626">Love Matters More</a> by Jared Byas 📚</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Social media encourages the myth that who we are is defined by the opinions we type. But the older I get, the less interested I am in how well people can script their beliefs in front of a computer and the more interested I am in how tenaciously they go about grinding out their moral existence. I’m impressed when someone can get up every single day, determined to be a better human being than he or she was yesterday. Typing out what we “stand for” is easy. But loving well isn’t. I am not down on typing out our opinions—clearly. I’m only down on thinking that typing in and of itself constitutes an ethical life. May we stop thinking that becoming the kind of person we want to be is as easy as typing “me too” at those we agree with and “stupid people” at those we don’t. That’s a distraction from the real work of being human. And I’m ready to work.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>Do you know the most disappointing thing about the United States of America?</p>
<p>That the entire narrative of and about the country is defined by a small handful of topics recycled so quickly that outsiders often don&rsquo;t even know which Police Officer killing, which mass shooting, which disappointing President, or which sexually abusive old white male you&rsquo;re all angry about this week. It&rsquo;s hard to keep up, and you need new stories. Not new fake stories so the rest of the world thinks you&rsquo;re cool again.

			 <p>Steve Jobs on how asking for help is a superpower:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never found anybody that didn&rsquo;t want to help me if I asked them for help. I called up Bill Hewlett (founder of HP) when I was 12 years old. He answered the phone himself. I told him I wanted to build a frequency counter. I asked if he had any
spare parts I could have. He laughed. He gave me the parts. And he gave me a summer job at HP working on the assembly line putting together frequency counters. I have never found anyone who said no, or hung up the phone. I just ask. Most people never pick up the phone and call. And that is what separates the people who do things, versus the people who just dream about them. You have to act.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>In every intellectual relationship there’s the person who recommends podcast episodes, and there’s the other person who doesn’t even listen to the recommended episodes.</p>
<p>In my and Scott’s relationship, I’m the recommending party.</p>
<p>But as is the fashion of the other person the two episodes of the one podcast that Scott recommended I listen this week, this is a banger.</p>
<p>Hallelujah, an <a href="https://www.pushkin.fm/podcasts/revisionist-history/hallelujah">episode of Malcolm Gladwell’s Revisionist History</a>, is possibly one of the most thought provoking 30 minutes of my life.</p>
<p>The single idea that at the point of release, the moment of deliverance, the second you ship this creative work, that it’s more than likely not done yet, terrifies me.</p>
<p>We live a life today where I do a thing and it’s done and we move on.</p>
<p>Contemplating that Leonard Cohen’s Hallelujah took the journey documented in this podcast, I’m going to sit with this for so long.</p>

<p>Every week, sometimes every day, Britt and my inbox is filled with couples worrying about what happens if it rains, or if it&rsquo;s too hot, or if something something. All valid worries, but they don&rsquo;t stress us out too much because we always find a way.

<p>That&rsquo;s what we do. We look for solutions, not problems.</p>

			 <p>16 years ago today the way I viewed the world changed completely. I can still remember seeing that little lump of plastic and metal in Steve Jobs&rsquo;s hand, watching a video stream, and thinking that everything changed. Today that remains ever so.</p>
<p>I believe that you can measure the meaning of something by imagining taking it away. What would life be like if we didn&rsquo;t have it? Like earlier today I mused to a friend that if a certain media property disappeared, no one would notice.</p>
<p>Imagine a world without the iPhone. You might point to Android phones, but 16 years ago today <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/20/5229618/android-started-over-the-day-the-iphone-was-announced">the team developing Android &lsquo;started over&rsquo;</a> and despite the common argument that iPhone copies Android&rsquo;s leadership, on that day, Android took iPhone&rsquo;s lead.</p>
<p>Even comparing the two, Android was just a software platform under development. iPhone was hardware and software. Not long after it became a software development platform and the world as we know it today changed completely. Services you take for granted were enabled that day.</p>
<p>16 years is nothing special, but every year when this date rolls around, and the subsequent anniversaries, I reflect how years later we&rsquo;ve not experienced a tectonic shift like that since.</p>

			 <p>When you elope in a far-away destination you’re choosing a very different vibe and moment than a domestic elopement. It firmly places your ceremony - the beginning of your marriage - in the middle of an adventure. Between customs, packing, flights, delays, transfers, language barriers, different foods and weather, it’s impossible to not revel in the moment as you take a deep breath of that fresh international air and exchange vows with me and the @elopementcollective in some epic location like Italy, Iceland, or anywhere in-between.</p>
<p>I’m up for a European wedding adventure any day of the week, but in June and July 2024 I’ll be there with The Elopement Collective plus House of Lucie and Jason Corroto.</p>

<li>all the Remarkable 2 you want with the benefit of all the Kindle you want</li>

<p>Kindle Scribe Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>so very big</li>
<li>no buttons</li>
<li>too big</li>
<li>a little heavy</li>

			 <p>Steve Jobs in 1990:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My observation is that the doers are the major thinkers. The people that really create the things that change this industry are both the thinker and doer in one person. And if we really go back and we examine, you know, did Leonardo have a guy off to the side that was thinking five years out in the future what he would paint or the technology he would use to paint it? Of course not. Leonardo was the artist, but he also mixed all his own paints. He also was a fairly good chemist. He knew about pigments, knew about human anatomy. And combining all of those skills together, the art and the science, the thinking and the doing, was what resulted in the exceptional result. And there is no difference in our industry. The people that have really made the contributions have been the thinkers and the doers.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>Dear the United States of America,</p>
<p>I would like to submit my application to become your house&rsquo;s Speaker. I&rsquo;m of the understanding than you do not currently have a speaker, and you are in need of a speaker. It just so happens that speaking is one of the few things on this planet that I am really good at.</p>
<p>Attached is photographic evidence of me at to Kirsten and Todd&rsquo;s wedding speaking quite well, you will notice them as much as I speak really good, I also slide into the background of the story if the photographer uses the correct aperture.</p>
<p>For references, please see my Google and Facebook page reviews, where I maintain an almost five star rating, with the exception of a few random spam accounts that have left me one star reviews without any reason.</p>
<p>It is possible that me being an Australian currently residing in Mexico may be an issue, but for the next week, I am still in Tennessee. If you are willing to give me a green card, I am willing to speak at your house.</p>
<p>I am also available for weddings, parties, anything.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely, the next speaker of the United States of America, Josh &ldquo;Married By Josh&rdquo; Withers.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Just discovered my favourite parable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A businessman is sitting on the beach of a small fishing village when he sees a fisherman approach the shore with his daily haul. Impressed by the quality of the fish, the businessman asks the fisherman how long it took him to bring in his catch.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Just a short while,” the fisherman replies.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Why don’t you stay out longer to catch more fish?” the businessman asks.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Because this is all I need.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“But then what do you do with your time?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I sleep late, catch a few fish, play with my kids, take a nap with my wife, and then join my buddies in town to drink wine and play guitar,” the fisherman responds.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The businessman is shocked. He explains that he has an MBA, and that if the fisherman follows his advice, he could help him grow his business. “You could buy a bigger boat,” the businessman says, “and use the proceeds to open your own cannery.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Then what?” the fisherman asks.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“You could move to the city to open a distribution center.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“And then what?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“You could expand your business internationally and eventually take your company public,” the businessman says. “When the time is right, you could sell your shares and become very rich.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“And then what?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Well, then you can retire, move to a small fishing village, sleep late, catch a few fish, play with your kids, take naps with your wife, and join your buddies in town to drink wine and play guitar.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The fisherman smiles at the businessman and continues down the beach.</p>
</blockquote>

			 <p>My second Amazon Kindle is a Kindle I&rsquo;ve owned since late 2016, my first generation Kindle Oasis. It&rsquo;s been a solid travel companion but after six years its battery barely lasts a day and I&rsquo;m hot for something new. I&rsquo;ve been waiting for a 2022/2023 release of a new Oasis and when the Scribe was released I started thinking this might not occur.</p>
<p>So while I was in native Amazon territory where deliveries are quick and returns are easily done at Whole Foods, I thought I&rsquo;d buy both - the latest Kindle Oasis and the new Kindle Scribe - and return the one I liked the least.</p>

<p>Matt asked for Tequila ratings.
Mike asked Why Mexico?
Kristie asked why people fly their celebrant around the world for weddings, why not get someone local?
Dan asked What&rsquo;s the best low-key wedding I&rsquo;ve done. Steele demanded an answer.
Chantell asked how often I meet with my couples to do personalised ceremonies I can do without a script.
Luke asked about any time saving tips in business.
Mel asked if I was quitting weddings now?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I have noticed that when all the lights are on, people tend to talk about what they are doing — their outer lives. Sitting round in candlelight or firelight, people start to talk about how they are feeling – their inner lives. They speak subjectively, they argue less, there are longer pauses.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To sit alone without any electric light is curiously creative. I have my best ideas at dawn or at nightfall, but not if I switch on the lights — then I start thinking about projects, deadlines, demands, and the shadows and shapes of the house become objects, not suggestions, things that need to done, not a background to thought.”</p>

<li>
<p>Mastodon’s celebration of the open web, the indie web, is an evergreen celebration that enough people, me included, will always get onboard with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mastodon is everything we’re looking for in Twitter except it’s not Twitter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No one single ego can rule the Mastodon, fediverse, indieweb, open web. Instead many many egos can, will, and do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mastodon isn’t a complete social media product, still requiring many features to even gain parity with what the average internet user considers the bare minimum for a social networking product. Today I couldn’t upload a video because it was too good of a quality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The business model of Mastodon/the Fediverse is missing links that only generosity can complete. Which is nice amongst friends. But all of us generous admins, hosts, mods have our limits (or jobs, kids, relationships). That’s the strength begging Micro.Blog, $5 a month and you’re good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s actually a lot of work and resource to run a Mastodon instance still. Digital Ocean’s $200 free spend will run out soon.</p>

			 <p>Cute. On <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/19/science/time-leap-second-bipm.html">the news that the leap second is being removed</a>, Rev. Pavel Gabor, an astrophysicist and the vice director of the Vatican Observatory Research Group in Tucson, Arizona said that,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;atomic timekeeping was just one example of how the world was becoming incomprehensible to the average person, and that scientists had a responsibility to help people feel in control of their lives.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And he went on to say,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I think sensitivity to this mistrust of elites, mistrust of experts, mistrust of science and institutions, that’s something that’s a very real problem in today’s world,” he said. “And let’s not contribute to it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m so looking forward to the world returning to normalcy and peace in 2035 when the leap second is removed.</p>

			 <p>Sharing <a href="https://news.lettersofnote.com/p/gods-law">God&rsquo;s Law</a> from Letters of Note, as seen multiple times around the internet and on The West Wing, now in it&rsquo;s original form, by Kent Ashcraft:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Dr. Laura,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God’s law. I have learned a great deal from you, and I try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend homosexuality, for example, I will simply remind him or her that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination. End of debate.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some of the other laws in Leviticus and Exodus and how to best follow them.</p>
<p>When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord (Leviticus 1:9). The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. How should I deal with this?</p>
<p>I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as stated in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?</p>
<p>I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanliness (Leviticus 15:19-24). The problem is, how can I tell?</p>
<p>I have tried asking, but most women take offense.
Leviticus 25:44 states that I may buy slaves from the nations that are around us. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify?</p>
<p>I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself?</p>
<p>A friend of mine says that even though eating shellfish is an abomination (Leviticus 10:10), it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don’t agree. Can you settle this?</p>
<p>Leviticus 20:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here?</p>
<p>I know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident you can help. Thank you again for reminding us that God’s Word is eternal and unchanging.</p>
<p>Your devoted disciple and adoring fan.</p>

			 <p>Maeve Brennan in a letter to Tillie Olsen via Letters of Note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I have been trying to think of the word to say to you that would never fail to lift you up when you are too tired or too sad not [to] be downcast. But I can think only of a reminder—you are all it has. You are all your work has. It has nobody else and never had anybody else. If you deny it hands and a voice, it will continue as it is, alive, but speechless and without hands. You know it has eyes and can see you, and you know how hopefully it watches you. But I am speaking of a soul that is timid but that longs to be known. When you are so sad that you ‘cannot work’ there is always a danger fear will enter in and begin withering around. A good way to remain on guard is to go to the window and watch the birds for an hour or two or three. It is very comforting to see their beaks opening and shutting.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>Street names in Baja are wild, in that they barely exist. To prove my residence/address I need to show an electrical bill. So this street a few blocks from our house is hilariously named.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s named after a gardener who still lives in that street, and drinks multiple litres of alcohol a day. His nick name is &ldquo;Litre&rdquo; or in Spanish &ldquo;Litro&rdquo;. So a gringo who loves him had a street sign made, attached to the pole at the start of the street, now everyone calls it Litro Street.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/11/14/a-proposal-a.html">A proposal: a social network owned by creators</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/11/14/a-proposal-a.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-11-15 07:52:37 &#43;1000">Nov 15, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Social networks have three assets: a network effect (so we can connect with people), content moderation (so we can actually enjoy using it), content (so we have something to enjoy/consume).</p>
<p>The content creators have always been at the bottom of the stack. Underpaid and under-appreciated,&quot; by the social network owners.</p>
<p>So what if we made a Twitter owned by us?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a turning tide against Twitter and Meta towards Mastodon, and honestly Mastodon is pretty good. It&rsquo;s decentralised in that you can sign up to any Mastodon server/instance and talk to other people on other instances, that&rsquo;s called federation. It&rsquo;s one of the tentpole features of Mastodon. Federation, or the fediverse, means you can sign up to, for example, the <a href="http://mastodon.social">@mastodon.social</a> instance and if I&rsquo;m in <a href="http://aus.social">@aus.social</a>, we can talk to each other.</p>
<p>But if we&rsquo;re both on the same instance there&rsquo;s some nice ways of discovering other people and other content, in particular discovering people and content on the same server.</p>
<p>Plus the instance you choose to be on has a brand story. If you&rsquo;re communicating how to find and follow you on Mastodon there&rsquo;s a branding aspect. Imagine saying on a podcast &ldquo;follow me at Josh at Mastodon dot social&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;follow me at Josh at cool name dot com.&rdquo; It can&rsquo;t be long until corporations and large brands take the opportunity to start their own instance.</p>
<p>So what if content creators got in early and had our own network?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my proposal, to start a Mastodon instance owned and run by content creators. Podcasters, writers, newsletter writers, vloggers, video makers, photographers, personalities, broadcasters - creators. Because we&rsquo;d own the network we&rsquo;d reap the benefits, instead of sending them to VCs, corporations, or Elon Musk/Zuckerberg.</p>
<p>Because all the creators have existing networks - and products - we&rsquo;d flex our influence to bring audiences to the new network. Also, in case it&rsquo;s not obvious, nothing will be taken away from your existing work. What changes is that instead of providing Twitter and Meta with free content that upholds the network effect that feeds their shareholders/stakeholders, you&rsquo;re providing free content to build and uphold your own network that operates like a co-op content farmers market.</p>
<p>I own the domain name &rsquo;theradio.au&rsquo; and I reckon it&rsquo;d be kind of cool to say &lsquo;follow me at Josh at theradio dot au&rsquo; in a video or a link o my profile being <a href="https://theradio.au/@josh">theradio.au/@josh</a> &hellip; or insert your content brand in place of Josh.</p>
<p>I like the generic-ish name, and the idea of &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on the radio&rdquo; as a term of phrase for using the social media platform, particularly as actually being on the FM/AM radio means so little.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m open to listening to ideas around how to start, run, and do this well. There are costs to running a Mastdon instance and because the benefits run to creators I&rsquo;d look to creators to fund the project. With enough people it might be $50-100 a year, and I see the incentives run in the right direction if creators fund and own it. Other business models lend themselves to other incentives and next minute you&rsquo;re owned by Elon Musk.</p>
<p>Weigh in on the social platform of your choice or email me at <a href="mailto:josh@withers.co">josh@withers.co</a>.</p>

			 <p>Why don&rsquo;t we use the word &ldquo;swashbuckling&rdquo; more? It&rsquo;s a very cool word.</p>
<p>The MacOS dictionary defines swashbuckling as an adjective as &ldquo;engaging in daring and romantic adventures with bravado or flamboyance&rdquo; and as a noun &ldquo;daring and romantic adventure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It came to mind as I read Margaret Sullivan&rsquo;s book, Newsroom Confidential, and she recalled the story of Jeff Bezos addressing the Washington Post staff:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Even in the world of journalism, I think the Post is just a little more swashbuckling. There’s a little more swagger. There’s a tiny bit of bad-assness here at the Post.” After some applause and laughs from the exuberant crowd, Bezos elaborated on those words with some context: “Without quality journalism, swashbuckling would just be dumb. Swashbuckling without professionalism leads to those epic-fail YouTube videos. It’s the quality journalism at the heart of everything. And then when you add that swagger and that swashbuckling, that’s making this place very, very special.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My new life goal is to be described as swashbuckling.</p>

			 <p>We’re heading back to Hawaii in mid-January and it got me thinking about the last time I was there and I created a marriage ceremony across the bay from Aerosmith’s Steven Tyler house.</p>
<p>I’ll never know if Steve witnessed me in my element on Maui, but they’ve never officially said what I Don&rsquo;t Want to Miss a Thing was about …</p>
<p>Anyway, this is just your regular reminder that I make epic marriage ceremonies from Ipswich to Iceland and everywhere between.</p>

			 <p>Over seven years since Workflow first graced the Apple ecosystem - since then being acquired by Apple and renamed Shortcuts which makes it so easy to Google for information about - it&rsquo;s still a little-known tool on the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.</p>
<p>My favourite shortcut - it&rsquo;s the ultimate shortcut - created by the ultimate Shortcuts guy, Federico Viticci at Macstories, is <a href="https://www.macstories.net/ios/apple-frames-3-0-completely-rewritten-support-for-iphone-14-pro-and-dynamic-island-new-devices-multiple-display-resolutions-and-more/">Apple Frames</a>. The shortcut has just been updated to its third version and is ever more powerful and works even better.</p>
<p>You feed the shortcut one or more screenshots you&rsquo;ve taken on the device, and it inserts the screenshot into an Apple device frame, so the resultant image carries more context. Examples beneath of some quick single screenshots, and three iPhone screenshots shared together in one image.</p>

			 <p>I am continually fascinated whilst reading Letters of Note as to how people not of this time, people who lived 50, 100, or 200 years ago talk about the hardships and tribulations of modern life - in their own context - being hard and negative.</p>
<p>Martha Gellhorn in a letter to Raleigh Trevelyan on boxing day 1967 wrote &ldquo;Do you think it’s at all sensible to wish anyone a Happy New Year? I think the best one can do nowadays is just to wish that we all survive, year by year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or as the preacher spoke to their church a few hundred years before Christ, recorded in the book of Ecclesiastes, &ldquo;Meaningless! Meaningless! Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless!&rdquo; and they continued, &ldquo;I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of humanity, forevermore, just trying to survive, year by year.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m wondering whether &ldquo;stay in your medium lane&rdquo; is good advice for Elon Musk and Twitter today?</p>
<p>I think about Instagram starting as a still photo medium and how I like it less as it has changed lanes. Facebook started as a &ldquo;friend-to-friend connection&rdquo; medium, and I like it less as Adam Mosseri has obsessed over Reels and videos.</p>
<p>Twitter started as, and mostly still is, a text medium.</p>
<p>The human brain likes to catalogue and silo things. Twitter is a textual medium, and all of us on it love that about it.</p>
<p>If Twitter wants to evolve to take on YouTube and Facebook and leave text behind, that will be its death knell. Not headwinds in the marketplace, but the fact that those of us that like to read and write text, want to connect and share in a place that champions reading and writing text.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I<a href="https://micro.blog/joshua">moved my writing and sharing</a> to <a href="https://micro.blog/joshua">Micro.blog</a> when it launched. <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> champions text and text sharing, whilst also encouraging you to own your content/text.</p>
<p>If anything was going to take Twitter&rsquo;s place today, in my humble opinion, it would be <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a>, because it has a business plan, it has a network, by design it&rsquo;s healthy and good for the soul, but it champions the reading and writing of text.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/11/05/wondering-about-unsplash.html">Wondering about Unsplash and why my recent work isn&#39;t resonating</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/11/05/wondering-about-unsplash.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-11-06 04:27:36 &#43;1000">Nov 6, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="https://unsplash.com/@joshwithers">I&rsquo;ve been uploading to Unsplash</a> for almost five years, and people always ask why I would submit my work to a website that gives it away mostly for free?</p>
<p>I consider <a href="https://unsplash.com">Unsplash</a> my photography mentor and university. Because ultimately, I believe, that good work resonates with people. Firstly it has to resonate with you, but secondly with someone else. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be the most popular work in the history of work, but a successful artwork resonates with at least as many people as that created it, in my humble opinion.</p>
<p>I started uploading in early 2018.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So back to Unsplash, I&rsquo;ve shared 505 photos that have been viewed over 152 million times, and downloaded and used over 800 thousand times, making me one of the &ldquo;1000 most seen contributors ever&rdquo; which is lovely.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A problem though is my recent work. Work that is arguably better, shot on better cameras, with better lenses, and better colour grading &hellip; because I&rsquo;ve learned and gotten better with better gear.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Of my most viewed photos &ldquo;of all time&rdquo; only two photos from the last year are in my top 70 images. After 70 they start appearing a little, but inside the top 70, <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/aGwwy7R7lgU">number 69</a> is a boring drone shot, and <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/7QIiGhX4L24">number 8</a> was an outlier. Luna had woken up early so the two of us wanted to go watch the sun rise, and we both took our cameras.</p>
<p>Obviously the longer a work has been available, the more views and downloads it can get. Secondly, as Unsplash is online longer, I&rsquo;m assuming more photographers are uploading more work, so the pool gets larger, and the available views and downloads may lessen.</p>
<h3 id="when-or-why-would-i-leave-unsplash">When or why would I leave Unsplash?</h3>
<p>I used to think I&rsquo;d leave Unsplash when I reached 1 million downloads. But I think the truer statement is that I&rsquo;d stop giving my work away for free, when it resonated with enough people who wanted to pay for it.</p>
<p>How do I reach that number? How do I find those people? I have no idea. The only thing I know to do today is step one, to create, step two and three and four can&rsquo;t even happen without step one.</p>
<p>Money is nice, but making work that resonates with people, work that makes you and I feel something. That&rsquo;s like a little bit nicer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll leave you with my <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/VyOUw5byHlc">most popular piece</a>, a photo from a backroad before sunrise in Queenstown, New Zealand, shot on my old original DJI Mavic Pro, with just enough light for it to be a sharp and in focus image.</p>

<p>A big cup of black coffee, and I take the temperature and black-coffee-ness out of it with a dash of dairy.</p>
<p>In Baja an Americano is basically a long black, but often filter coffee which would be fine if it was lukewarm. An espresso is an espresso shot. A long black doesn&rsquo;t exist. I got close today, but once I asked for &ldquo;like an Americano but hot&rdquo;, they also brought out hot milk, and you don&rsquo;t want hot milk in this drink.</p>
<p>My fortune for help on how to order a &ldquo;long black with cream/milk&rdquo; in Spanish, or in a way that local baristas will understand.</p>

			 <p>I’m reflecting on the recent Optus hack today as I wonder what to do with my phone number I’ve had for 20 odd years.</p>
<p>So much of modern society needs a phone number to work and to identify us.</p>
<p>New services register with a phone number and text message verification code, trusting that only you would have your phone number or SIM card.</p>
<p>When I turn off my Australian SIM card in Mexico iMessage warns me the clock has started.</p>
<p>It’s kind of ridiculous that something as fragile as a phone number is the backbone of identity.</p>
<p>I think do Dave Winer’s ten year old blog post proposing <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2012/02/23/thinkingOutLoudDnsAsId.html">DNS as a form of ID</a>, but I feel like that would exclude so many normies.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, in many parts of Mexico the police will take your number plate or drivers license back to the police station as that’s the closest the national identity systems don’t really exist here.</p>
<p>How are we supposed to verify who we are? Maybe a blue tick will help?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Thats a solid mark of an artist, that they create from the outside-ness, the loneliness, and in doing so they bit the hand that feeds.</p>
<p>Just yesterday a photographer friend and I were lamenting this feeling in ourselves. It’s why I found it so easy to transplant to a new country, maybe why I feel so at home with an airline ticket.</p>
<p>So if you feel alone, you’re not alone, despite the fact you truly are.</p>

			 <p>Britt and I are watching Netflix&rsquo;s new show The Mole at the moment and as that guy who knows Queensland like the back of his hand I&rsquo;ve been following the filming locations keenly. (If you know what that Daintree resort is, please tell me!)</p>
<p>So as the team reached &ldquo;The Great Barrier Reef&rdquo; aka The Whitsundays I immediately recognised the location as Woodward Bay, just a few minutes&rsquo; drive north of Airlie Beach. Visitors in the past include the King of Morocco, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, but most importantly for this story, the owner&rsquo;s husband, Jodie Rich. Apparently, they all helicoptered in, but I just drove when I visited.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been brought in - pretty sure it&rsquo;s 1999 or 2000 - to install two Alcatel PABX telephone systems, one that sits at the front gate, and another in the main compound, connected by fibre optic, to allow the main compound to make and receive phone calls, but also for the fancy new gate to be opened by phone call.</p>
<p>I worked for a local company called Business Solutions, and my experience there has always stuck with me. We were a one-stop shop where we provided actual business solutions, not just products. I still love doing that in businesses today.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I&rsquo;m on this amazing property that Tom Cruise has just stayed at, and Japanese property developer, Kumagai Gumi, has just dropped $150 million on the property, then sold it to Jodee Rich&rsquo;s wife for $2.5 million so that&rsquo;s probably a totally cool and normal transaction.</p>
<p>The whole thing was out of reach of ASIC as One Tel went broke because the husband didn&rsquo;t own the property that was attributed to him, but his wife did. That&rsquo;s the kind of business sense that gets you places, like starting your own top-level domain (.CEO) and NFT.NYC, kill me now, this bloke has such an epic legacy of grifting.</p>
<p>Seeing the property in The Mole was cool, it looked so similar twenty years on. It is honestly a really beautiful property. Back then they allegedly had lasers across the bay to keep people out, and as a young bloke, it&rsquo;s the nicest property I&rsquo;ve ever stepped foot on. I remember being told that the coffee table was made from a door of a monastery.</p>
<p>Interested in staying the night? It&rsquo;s only <a href="https://woodwarkbay.com.au">five figures a night</a>.</p>
<p>And if you need a PABX installed in a weird situation twenty years ago, give me a call.</p>

			 <p>Sell everything and start again somewhere else, it’s awesome!</p>
<p>When I first started as a computer tech back in 1998 there was a really complex procedure we’d undertake if a computer just wasn’t working properly. We’d reformat it, wipe everything clean, and reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>I feel like that’s what’s happening to us. A good old fashioned life-defrag, a reinstall of our operating system, getting us back into working order.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>We&rsquo;re in Mexico at the moment and I have thoughts on spending Australian money abroad. Four years ago today I became an <em>Up Bank</em> customer, and it&rsquo;s one of the best things I&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The original sell was that if you had an <em>Up debit Mastercard</em> you could turn up at an international ATM or EFTPOS machine and swipe away without getting dodgy international fees. The payment would be made at the current rate, nothing dodgy or stupid. They lived up to that promise, and they still do today. Britt and I have moved all of our personal banking to Up and love everything about the bank, the app, the debit Mastercards, everything.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re travelling overseas soon I could not recommend <em>Up</em> more. I started as an <em>Up</em> customer for international travel only, and after using the app more and more we became full-time customers.</p>
<p>The only thing <em>Up</em> couldn&rsquo;t do inside itself was to purchase an international currency and spend that currency overseas. You might want to do this if you are travelling somewhere for a longer period of time than the week or two a holiday might be, like us moving to Mexico. (Side note: Up does have a current partnership with Wise, and I understand it&rsquo;s just an easier way to transfer money to Wise.)</p>
<p>It looked like the Australian dollar would be going down on the Mexican peso over the next few months so I wanted to hedge against this and purchase some pesos. I have already used <em>Wise</em> (formerly Transferwise) for many international payments for our business, but hadn&rsquo;t used the issued debit cards or used the international currency bank account feature yet.</p>
<p>Qantas had also launched a &ldquo;business-grade&rdquo; version of its <em>Qantas Travel Money</em> product called <em>Qantas Business Money</em> and they had big Qantas points offer available recently, so I took the opportunity to use both products. I moved a considerable amount of Australian Dollars to <em>Qantas Business Money</em> to help us purchase a car here, and then moved a similar amount to <em>Wise</em> for spending money. <em>Qantas Business Money</em> is a Qantas service provided by <em>Airwallex</em>, a Melbourne company with a handful of offices worldwide.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A few points on the three different travel money products.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Up</em> has been seamless and worked (AUD-&gt;MXN) all the time at point of sale and ATM.</li>
<li>My Australian-issued <em>American Express</em> has not worked (AUD-&gt;MXN) at point of sometimes.</li>
<li>The <em>Wise</em> card has worked (MXN-&gt;MXN) at point of sale all but once, and I&rsquo;m betting that was something at the gas station, as the card worked inside the gas station but not at the attendant&rsquo;s EFTPOS machine on the forecourt.</li>
<li>I transferred Mexican pesos from <em>Wise</em> to a Mexican bank account on a Sunday evening Mexico time and by the time I&rsquo;d woken up I had received confirmation it had worked and the recipient had received the funds.</li>
<li>I transferred Mexican pesos from <em>Qantas Business Money</em> to buy a car on Friday morning at 11am Los Cabos time and it&rsquo;s just gone 1pm Monday morning and the money still hasn&rsquo;t arrived to the recipient&rsquo;s account.</li>
<li>AirWallex support is operational 9-5 Monday to Friday Melbourne time. Even inside that time the phone number isn&rsquo;t answered, and neither is the San Francisco office&rsquo;s phone number answered. At this stage I am assuming the Airwallex and Qantas Business Money support team is a concrete block in the corner of the office.</li>
<li>After doing business in a different country for a week <strong>I could not recommend against <em>Qantas</em> and <em>Airwallex</em> more. Do not use them if you want transfers to happen swiftly and wish to have support when things go wrong.</strong> I&rsquo;ve had previous issues with the <em>Qantas Travel Money</em> built into the <em>Qantas Frequent Flyer</em> card, I don&rsquo;t think anyone at Qantas has actually ever used these products abroad, so neither should you.</li>
<li>After three days silence a Qantas Business Money staff member told me that they needed to check for fraud and safety which would be fine if this was communicated, but also they promised the transaction would take place as banks opened today and it has not.</li>
</ul>
<p>Which banking products should you use?</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are happy with making withdrawals and payments at the going rate at the time, I recommend using Up.</li>
<li>If you want to buy foreign currency and spend it abroad, use Wise.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve also had success swiping my <em>ANZ Frequent Flyer Blank</em> Visa card but I have only carried that as a backup.</li>
<li>I haven&rsquo;t tested all the Australian bank credit cards, I understand many of them are fine.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, you&rsquo;re welcome to Google the products and do your own research, you really should, but if you <a href="https://hook.up.me/withers">sign up for Up using this link</a> you get $5. If you <a href="https://wise.com/invite/u/joshuaw114">sign up for Wise using this link</a> you get a fee-free transfer of up to 500GBP and they pay me $90 for every three of you that signs up and transfers $300.</p>

			 <p>Some inherent problems in the internet of 2022, in my humble opinion:</p>
<ol>
<li>Everyone is too exposed to everyone else, for example, it&rsquo;s wild that anyone and everyone can read these words I&rsquo;m typing. It&rsquo;s beautiful and wild, but ultimately we aren&rsquo;t born ready to be so exposed. There&rsquo;s the smallest number of celebrities that have successfully been in the public spotlight for their whole lives and come out unharmed, and even those that keep a positive public identity have conspiracy theories made up about them (Hi, Tom Hanks). I don&rsquo;t think we were made to be in community with the whole planet.</li>
<li>Many people want to be more highly exposed, and believe that they are not exposed enough, and think everyone else needs to be exposed to them, their thoughts, their art, their work. We don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m actually ok with not knowing what Kanye West thinks at the moment.</li>
<li>What happens if the extremists don&rsquo;t live in the light but decamp off to the shadows? Do they become a problem for society? Do they impose on your and my own safety?</li>

<p>It&rsquo;s the internet equivalent of starting or building more and more new gated communities in a town to make it safer and better.</p>
<p>Ultimately the town without gated communities, but the ability to operate without the walls and gates is the better town.</p>
<p>What does that mean on a modern worldwide computing platform like the internet? Get a blog. Use your keyboard, type some words, upload some photos, and share them with your mates. Get a blog roll. Share the love and seek out the things you love.</p>
<p>The future of the internet isn&rsquo;t in the existing, or new, social networks or walled gardens. It&rsquo;s in freedom of expression and seeking your own inputs.</p>
<p>At least then when Kanye does something stupid, I just get to choose to not read his blog. But if you want to, you can.</p>

<li>There&rsquo;s a difference between good tacos and just tacos, good tacos are more likely to be in less-fancy buildings without flashy signage.</li>
<li>Processing your Mexican temporary residency is much harder than they make it sound.</li>
<li>Really should have learned more Spanish before getting on the plane.</li>
<li>Even a nice Hilton hotel is still, in the end, just a hotel.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s amazing how terrible a car can be to still be listed for sale here. I looked at a car for 60,000 pesos (just under $5,000AUD) and I think someone was murdered in it but it wasn&rsquo;t cleaned.</li>
<li>Horses, livestock, dogs and other animals all just roam free here. Must be tough for fencers to not be needed.</li>
<li>Lawns don&rsquo;t exist here unless you&rsquo;re in a fancy place. It&rsquo;d be hard to move here if your identity was built on how good your lawn is.</li>
<li>Very few Australians are here or have visited here. Many people are surprised to hear we travelled so far.</li>
<li>Should&rsquo;ve stopped for a night or two in Los Angeles. 26 hours door to door was a lot for two toddlers.</li>
<li>Always buy bottled water.</li>
<li>Oysters taste different here. Bad different.</li>
<li>I had to drive on the other side of the road for the first time in three years in the presence of a Mexican man whose car I was test driving. He must have spent the whole time wondering why a person who drove this bad wanted to buy a car.</li>
<li>Money transfers internationally are never as quick as you&rsquo;d imagine, especially over a weekend.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s little consistency between different offices of Mexican authorities. There&rsquo;s very much a local spirit in the decisions they make.</li>
<li>We love it here.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s quite hot.</li>
<li>Buy a good pram and travel cot, they&rsquo;re worth their weight in gold.</li>
<li>Pack light, you don&rsquo;t need all that stuff.</li>

			 <p>We left Los Cabos today for an adventure up to Todos Santos about an hour’s drive north of Cabo San Lucas.</p>
<p>A few observations.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The best branding I’ve seen for Mexican food yet is a restaurant called “Five Tacos and a Beer, Please.” You wouldn’t believe what the main item on the menu is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are a lot of parties in Mexico, and a lot of beer and spirits are sold and consumed. I was the only person at the OXXO (think 7/11) who didn’t buy alcohol while I was there.</p>

			 <p>I love <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1494942612">Morpho</a>, my new favourite currency (and other numbers) conversion iOS app.</p>
<p>Ahead of travelling to Mexico I wanted to find a new currency conversion app that did two-three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Had a Lock Screen widget to help me make purchasing decisions quickly and easily considering I still don’t really know how much 1,250 pesos is in personal terms.</li>
<li>If they couldn’t do Lock Screen then at least do a widget.</li>
<li>Once I opened the app, it gave me a few nuanced currency conversions. I wanted to be able to quickly get my head around AUD, MXN and USD numbers quickly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Morpho delivered plus they brought in other conversions like weights and temperature.</p>
<p>The widget is great - you can choose which conversion to show, as you can see in the screenshot I wanted to always have a sense of what things on menus were worth so I settled on “what’s 100 pesos worth in Aussie dollars?”</p>
<p>You can then tap the widget to open the app and whatever number you enter at the top is converted below.</p>
<p>Travelling internationally with an iPhone soon? You’ll like this. Even Britt appreciates it and I can never get her on to new apps.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“A typical Australian suburb spends about $4m on petrol and diesel per year. That creates half a job at the local petrol station which is mostly selling sugar and tobacco anyway – that’s like three things that can kill you in one store! Anyway, if everyone is driving electric vehicles and producing their own electricity, those $4m will stay in the community. We know from spending behaviour that 55% of that money will be spent locally, creating a huge number of jobs. Not just energy jobs, but it’ll be paying for better bakeries, new classrooms, a fresh coat of paint for the sports club, etc. I don’t think we ever really thought about just what a screamingly good thing that would be for every community.“</p>

			 <p>It was kind of fitting for one of my last weddings before we head to Mexico to be at Weddings at Tiffany&rsquo;s. One of my first was there as well, and it&rsquo;s one of my most memorable weddings because of how the groom thanked and encouraged me after the ceremony.</p>
<p>He said &ldquo;I thought you were going to be a really shit celebrant, but you were awesome!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over the last 14 years I hope I&rsquo;ve equally positively surprised you with my &ldquo;me-ness&rdquo; whilst also been a solid rock you can rely on when you get married. It has been, and will be, such an honour to hold that moment for you, I&rsquo;ve never taken it for granted. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re taking this sabbatical, because I&rsquo;d like to do this celebrant thing forever.</p>
<p>A guest at yesterday&rsquo;s wedding is still upset she couldn&rsquo;t book me for her wedding six years ago because I was booked then, and I&rsquo;m getting similar vibes from people emailing about 2023 weddings at the moment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be back - especially for tomorrow&rsquo;s wedding at Sanctuary Cove, and the couples I&rsquo;m coming back from Mexico to marry in November/December - but trust me when I say I don&rsquo;t think I could carry on marrying people next year after the last three without something breaking, so we&rsquo;re taking the courageous act of taking a break instead of being forced into one.</p>
<p>People always say this about their own job, but I know they&rsquo;re lying, because I have the best job in the world. Thank you for giving it to me.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.unmade.media/p/rupert-murdoch-goes-platinum-and">Tim Burrowes reports on Rupert Murdoch&rsquo;s &ldquo;remarkable&rdquo; 70-year career</a> in the media:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He created a newspaper empire which has shaped the culture of the English speaking world.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He made newspaper paywalls work when nobody else thought he would succeed.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He saw streaming coming and sold most of his TV and film interests to Disney at the top of the market.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I personally find the influence of News Corp and the Murdochs disgusting and intolerable, yet I can also look at that 70-year body of work and say it&rsquo;s remarkable, amazing and will most likely never be repeated in a similar scale. Which is most likely a good thing.</p>

			 <p>The world is starting to reflect on 2020-2022 and what everyone did, and how we reacted, and I&rsquo;m not reading many pieces that are all in with their support.</p>
<p>This is from <a href="https://sensiblemed.substack.com/p/towards-yom-kippur-an-israeli-physician">Dr Raya Leibowitz, Israeli oncologist, a scientist (MD/PhD) and the head of a medium-sized oncology institute in Israel</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I am writing so not to forget the response of governments and societies to the COVID-19 pandemic over the last 2.5 years; responses that were, for me and many others, dystopian. During this time, Israeli society, as I knew it, has dramatically changed for the worse.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The thing I&rsquo;m most interested in is how I even feel hesitant to share this piece because of the negative feedback I receive from my community for not being all-in on the response to the pandemic.</p>
<p>The article is a personal story of a doctor who held not-so-mainstream views and how her community rejected her. If the net effect of Covid is that you&rsquo;re alive but living with division in community, living with fear and hatred of others, I think I&rsquo;d rather be dead.</p>

			 <p>My anxiety is of the opinion that none of you really care about me, contacting me or enjoying our family travels, if that&rsquo;s so, please cease reading and thank you for confirming my deepest fears and anxieties. But, if you do wish to stay in contact with me and enjoy our photos and stories of lands far away, I have four notes for you:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Every email address you have for me is wrong unless it is my name then an @ symbol then my last name, finishing with a .co &hellip; delete all other addresses from your address book or contacts app. Email remains my personal favourite place to communicate, please email whenever and whatever you like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you must instant message with, or call, me I would prefer for it to happen on iMessage or FaceTime, contacting me with the same email address. If you refuse the beauty and glory of the apple ecosystem I am unsure how we can stay in contact. WhatsApp is ugly, Telegram is full of Russian spam, none of you use the Signal app, plus it&rsquo;s linked to my phone number which I&rsquo;ll get to in point three.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My phone number will be trashed, and in the future, I&rsquo;ll have other phone numbers that I&rsquo;d prefer to not have to keep any longer than internet access is required. I wish to de-link myself from phone numbers in general but the world seems to think they are important.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although I am often tempted to post and share on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and whatever is hot online, my heart longs for a time when we take control of the stories we read, when we personally decide what we get angry or happy about. So my contribution to this effort is to write, photograph, publish, and share on my own personal blog <a href="https://joshwithers.blog">joshwithers.blog</a> &hellip; there&rsquo;s also a weekly digest of what&rsquo;s been published there and you can get it by visiting at <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/subscribe">joshwithers.blog/subscribe</a> to subscribe.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you wish to engage in the same kind of blogging I am, I can highly recommend <a href="https://micro.blog">micro.blog</a>.</p>
<p>I publish, photograph, write, broadcast and share online to satisfy something inside of me that wants to contribute to the fabric of our society, to the story of our generation, and this is me doing that. If you think that&rsquo;s a bit weird, you&rsquo;ll love my blog.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>My reading device of choice has been a Kindle Oasis (2nd model) I picked up at a Best Buy in Vegas in December 2017. It fast became my favourite little gadget. The Oasis was last updated in July 2019 - and Britt owns that model. It&rsquo;s got a warmth setting and a smidge larger battery, but it&rsquo;s basically the same.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been waiting patiently for an Oasis upgrade or replacement. In the meantime I just have to recharge my Kindle every two days instead of every two months, no big deal ya know.</p>
<p>New Amazon product of the month, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/28/23375663/amazon-kindle-scribe-e-ink-tablet-stylus-event-price">Kindle Scribe</a>, has been drawing lots of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21403489/remarkable-2-e-ink-paper-tablet-review">Remarkable 2</a> comparisons, and avid readers of this blog might remember I was a <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2020/12/06/can-the-remarkable.html">big fan of my Remarkable</a>.</p>
<p>Since that review a few things have changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>I sold my iPad Pro because the Apple Silicon MacBooks married with a Remarkable 2 was a happier solution.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve now sold my Remarkable tablet because I&rsquo;ve been downsizing in preparation for living in Mexico and travelling around.</li>
<li>My Kindle Oasis remains unchanged, but desperate for replacement.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve also bought an iPad Mini because size - but it&rsquo;s a terribly underpowered machine so that&rsquo;s being relegated to &ldquo;TV on airplanes and buses&rdquo; duty with my kids.</li>
</ul>
<p>So does the Scribe fit the Remarkable-loving, iPad-replacing, Oasis-upgrading dream I&rsquo;ve been looking for?</p>
<p>It seems to be a really close fit, with one exception. The Oasis would have been one of the largest Kindles produced at 7&quot;, but the Scribe is a 10.2&quot; device, almost matching the Remarkable, and I think that&rsquo;s too big to lay in bed reading a book from.</p>
<p>So we wait.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“A legitimate musical counterculture will arise, with a cadre of new artists achieving superstar status while rejecting the roles of influencer and content provider. The motto “music comes first” will be a key part of their marketing message. The movement will have a name, but that word doesn’t exist yet.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Individuals who can identify rising talent will set up their web channels, and fill the role once played by the A&amp;R department at a record label. But there’s one big difference: they can do everything themselves without a huge corporation behind them. If these talent scouts have a web channel with a few million subscribers, they will have more clout than Sony (which, by the way, currently has a pathetic 40 thousand subscribers to its YouTube channel) or most other labels. They can sign artists, showcase them online, and build their audience—acting as sole operators, but with the influence of a big business.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“There’s a lot of good criticism of crime reporting. It fosters systemic racism. Crimes are reported on because of the novelty factor rather than merit. A lack of follow-ups means articles rarely show the full story of a crime (including if charges are dropped). It tends to uncritically share the narrative of police, even though they are unreliable narrators. And above all else, it publicises one of the lowest moments of someone’s life and probably makes it harder for them to right the ship.”</p>

<p>Music has been such a shared experience - shared joys, shared sorrows - it&rsquo;s such a valuable part of our cultural fabric that I wonder what the current state of music means for the fabric yet to be spun.</p>
<p>If I’m by myself I rarely listen to music, but with friends in the car, at concerts, or even sharing links to songs amongst us is where the songs make sense.</p>
<p>Is the divestment of the collective music experience another pointer towards a divided people?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The nerds at NASA are going to smash a spacecraft into an asteroid hurtling through space this morning. It’s going to happen about 11 million kilometres from where you’re sitting now — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6Z1E0mW2ag">and you can watch a livestream from 8am</a>. The recipient of our pummelling will be a 163-metre-wide asteroid called Dimorphos that is orbiting a larger, 780-metre-wide asteroid.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It won’t be one guy and a joystick controlling the trajectory (how cool would that be?) — NASA says software will determine the point of impact. There will be a nail-biting moment in the last 50 minutes, however, when the software will need to differentiate between the larger asteroid and Dimorphos, as BBC writes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Assuming all goes well, the livestream will cut off when the spacecraft hits, but luckily a mini satellite released from the spacecraft a few days ago will record the whole shebang from 50km away. Success will be measured by whether Dimorphos’ orbit (about 12 hours at the moment) is shortened by 10 minutes. But the chances are slim that we’ll actually need to do this in future — scientists reckon we’ve identified 95% of all monster asteroids that could cause a global calamity. The other 5%, however…</p>

			<h1><a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/09/26/qantas-t-seat.html">Qantas T80 seat selection reminder shortcut for Apple Shortcuts</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/09/26/qantas-t-seat.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-09-26 13:44:25 &#43;1000">Sep 26, 2022</time></a>

			 <p>Reading a recent <a href="https://www.pointhacks.com.au/qantas/t-80-rule-best-seats/">Point Hacks email about the ol&rsquo; &lsquo;T-80&rsquo; Qantas rule</a> reminded me of an Apple Shortcuts shortcut I&rsquo;d been meaning to make for a while. I&rsquo;m no programmer, or Shortcut-writer, but I whipped the shortcut up today and I think it works really well.</p>
<p>Stealing this next image from Point Hacks, extra seats open up 80 hours out from the flight:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you&rsquo;d like a reminder about that opportunity, <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/2c293f50c6ba4c4fb96e012adff0ff23">download the shortcut on your Apple device now</a>. It works on Mac, iOS, and iPadOS, basically anywhere Shortcuts works.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This Shortcut looks for a calendar entry in the next year that has the letters QF in it, assumes that&rsquo;s a calendar entry about a Qantas flight, and can create a reminder 80 hours before that flight to remind you that most seats that are blocked due to status are now unlocked and you&rsquo;re able to select that seat if it&rsquo;s not already taken.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s set up to look in all calendars and create a reminder in my Travel Reminders list, but you can edit it to your liking. My Qantas flights appear as part of a Tripit calendar subscription and this works fine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how the Shortcut works:</p>
<p>It looks through my calendar and shows me all the calendar entries coming up that contain the letters QF, luckily for us the English language doesn&rsquo;t afford us many words that use the letters q and f together, so it&rsquo;s an easy selection.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The Shortcut displays the flights, you choose one, and a reminder is created along with a link to the Qantas manage your booking page.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you use a different calendar system or a to-do/reminders system, it should retrofit if your system talks to Shortcuts like most do these days.</p>

			 <p>Patrick O&rsquo;Shaughnessy on the <a href="https://manual.withcompound.com/chapters/patrick-oshaughnessy-part-i">power of audio</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Audio feels to me like a secret hiding in plain sight. Everyone loves to learn, everyone loves content and loves consuming it, and it seems as though no matter how much great content is created, there&rsquo;s not enough of it. I find myself all the time without a great piece of content to consume. And the demand-supply thing just hasn&rsquo;t reached an equilibrium yet, maybe it never will. And audio is unique in the sense that it is at least 10 times easier to create an unbelievable hour of audio for me, and my format&rsquo;s interview, interviewing someone great like David. That episode between him and I took an hour and a half to record. It will probably be listened to, my guess is, millions of times by the time it&rsquo;s all said and done. An hour and a half for millions of listens. And people will listen all the way through, and they&rsquo;ll consume it all. If you translated that conversation into text, it would be about the length of a short book. If we wanted to create a book of similar quality, it would take a year, probably. I mean I&rsquo;ve written a book, it took me a year, and my book was not nearly as good as that conversation with David was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I subscribed for updates straight away.</p>

<p>The rest of 2019 occurs, 2020 is dropped on us like an atomic bomb and I’m left waiting, ever so patiently.</p>
<p>Then, at the end of July 2021 I got a pre-order in, a few hours after the rest of the fans in USA timezones did, so I got to Group 3.</p>

<p>2022 arrives and we as a family decide to go on sabbatical, pack up shop in Australia, hit the road and travel around Mexico.</p>
<p>Two weeks before our flight, I get this update.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/359/2022/78c027c17e.jpg" alt=""></p>

But, I reckon every single human inside our national sports codes needs to understand that they’re getting a pretty bad reputation for their racism and sexism and maybe a hotel foyer bar isn’t the place for it.

As a pioneering rock climber in California’s Yosemite Valley in the 1960s, Mr. Chouinard lived out of his car and ate damaged cans of cat food that he bought for five cents apiece. Even today, he wears raggedy old clothes, drives a beat up Subaru and splits his time between modest homes in Ventura and Jackson, Wyo. Mr. Chouinard does not own a computer or a cellphone.”</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I acquired a new lens for my Canon EOS R5 camera today, the new Canon RF 24mm f/1.8. I&rsquo;m generally a fan of a long lens, like my favourite 70-200mm. If I had a pack horse with me (and endless money) I&rsquo;d have the <a href="https://www.digidirect.com.au/canon-rf-600mm-f-4l-is-usm-lens">$20,000 600mm</a> on me at all times. But for family photos, portraits, some landscapes, and vlogging you need something a little wider.</p>
<p>Britt loves a 35mm, me not so much. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed my little 50mm, but it&rsquo;s not wide enough, in that it&rsquo;s not wide at all. I trialled the RF 16m but that&rsquo;s too warped and wide.</p>
<p>When Canon announced the new RF 24mm I had three positive thoughts:</p>
<ol>
<li>The main camera on iPhones today is a 26mm equivalent, and the iPhone is where I fell in love with making photography</li>
<li>With an R5 I can punch in with a 1.6x crop, which is a 38mm equivalent, so I can still get a tighter shot and although it&rsquo;s cropping the 44.8 megapixels from the sensor, there&rsquo;s still plenty to spare.</li>
<li>My photo kit had gotten too big, particularly if we&rsquo;re travelling.</li>
</ol>
<p>So I sold my 16mm, 35mm, and I&rsquo;m about to sell my 50mm, and I&rsquo;ll be left with this 24mm and my 70-200.</p>
<p>How does the Canon RF 24mm compare to an iPhone 12 Pro 26mm? Here&rsquo;s two moments captured by both, and edited in Lightroom on the iPhone with my friend Bec&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.storykeeper.co/presets">Story Keeper presets</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;While Fred Lorz was greeted as the apparent winner, he was later disqualified as he had hitched a ride in a car for part of the race. The actual winner, Thomas Hicks, was near collapse and hallucinating by the end of the race, a side effect of being administered brandy, raw eggs, and strychnine by his trainers. The fourth-place finisher, Andarín Carvajal, took a nap during the race after eating spoiled apples.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>Rob Hardy on non-coercive marketing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The key ingredient in non-coercive marketing is the golden rule. We should market to others the way we&rsquo;d want to be marketed to ourselves. Non-coercive marketing places full authority and trust in people. It creates the conditions under which they can make empowered decisions for themselves, and do so in their own time. It doesn&rsquo;t seek to persuade, manipulate, or pester people into a decision that&rsquo;s already been made for them. It merely opens new doors, tells the truth about what&rsquo;s behind those doors, then surrenders the outcome, trusting that the right people will step through when they&rsquo;re ready.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>An update to the whole <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/06/28/off-to-the.html">&lsquo;my photos were stolen and published in a book at Kmart&quot; story</a>:</p>
<p>Before beginning any legal proceedings I sent them an invoice for a &ldquo;plucked from the sky&rdquo; number to license my photos to them. $2,200 an image, $8,800.</p>
<p>The publisher freaked out, took the book off the shelves, and called me to apologise. They ended the phone call with a commitment to come back with a compensation plan, but so far nothing.</p>
<p>$2,035 to send a lawyer&rsquo;s letter on a hope and a prayer that they respond.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be a lot more money to take it to court.</p>
<p>Sitting here wondering how to respond, so I sent a text. Thank god autocorrect softened the blow.</p>

<li>If you can’t correct it, or change it in any way, you should just pretend that you have. It’s not a problem anymore. Good news!</li>
<li>If you can’t even pretend not to have corrected the situation, you should just not show up, because it’s very painful for the rest of us to see you in your current condition.</li>

<p>“There are plenty of well-documented reasons to distrust Instagram — the platform where one is never not branding, never not making Facebook money, never not giving Facebook one’s data — but most unnerving are the ways in which it has led me to distrust myself. After countless adventures through the black hole, my propensity to share, perform, and entertain has melded with a desire far more cynical: to be liked, quantifiably, for an idealized version of myself, at a rate not possible even ten years ago. I think I am a writer and an actor and an artist. But I haven’t believed the purity of my own intentions ever since I became my own salesperson, too.”</p>

			<h1><a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/08/10/answers-to-the.html">Answers to the 10 most common questions people ask about us moving to Mexico</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/08/10/answers-to-the.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-08-10 17:11:58 &#43;1000">Aug 10, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Answering the most common questions I’ve been asked about Britt and I moving to Mexico with our two kids:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>When do you go?</strong> October 10, 2022, then I come back for a month’s work around Australia Nov-Dec and then I’m back in Mexico before Christmas.</li>
<li><strong>Where will you go?</strong> I’ll let you know when we get there. We’re going to float around and do some housesitting gigs and try to find our place in the country. Honestly, it might not even be Mexico in the end. The goal isn’t to go to Mexico, the goal is to leave our normal routines and life, and Mexico seemed like as good as any place to get a residency visa. But of course, we are going to Mexico and I always think of the people that move to Australia and go to Sydney, I reckon those internationals miss out. I don’t want to end up in the Sydney of Mexico, or the Surfers Paradise. I’d love to end up in the Tugun of Mexico, somewhere small and beautiful and unique.</li>
<li><strong>When will you come back?</strong> We’ll let you know when we’re back.</li>
<li><strong>How will you afford it?</strong> <a href="http://tugunpause.au">Please book our house, The Tugun Pause, on Airbnb</a> … plus I’d love for <a href="https://unsplash.com/@joshwithers">my photography</a> to mean something financially - you can buy prints at <a href="https://art.josh.withers.co">art.josh.withers.co</a>. Also, we&rsquo;re still running the Elopement Collective and also mentoring celebrants at The Celebrant Institute.</li>
<li><strong>What about the cartels?</strong> What about the snakes, spiders, crocodiles, and dropbears in Australia? Mexico is a really big nation, the whole place isn’t Narcos. I would encourage you to develop a wider view and taste of the world if you think that Mexico is all drug cartels and people smuggling.</li>
<li><strong>Why Mexico?</strong> Why not?</li>
<li><strong>What will happen to our existing businesses?</strong> We’ll still lead and operate <a href="https://withers.co/elopementcollective">The Elopement Collective</a> remotely and I’m still in partnership with Sarah at <a href="https://celebrant.institute">The Celebrant Institute</a> so my celebrant training and mentoring efforts will continue. Being a celebrant, that’s on ice for a season. Consider it a sabbatical.</li>
<li><strong>Why?</strong> The last two years have destroyed us. This is an effort to take back who we are, who we want to be, and what kind of childhood we want our kids to have. We’ve lost more than our accountant could count through this pandemic, and we’re still on the same hamster wheel. I tried changing the hamster wheel to real estate, but the truth is I needed to actually get off all hamster wheels.</li>
<li><strong>Will you do weddings in Mexico?</strong> I’m currently without a work visa in Mexico, so no, but I’m exploring options. Nothing will really matter until I reach my goal anyhow.</li>
<li><strong>What’s your goal, seeing as though you just mentioned it?</strong> My goal is to not know what to do tomorrow. When I don’t know what to do tomorrow, I’ll allow myself to start planning for the next season with Britt and the girls as a team.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, if you’ve gotten this far you probably care about us as a family and are interested in our story. I’m fairly whelmed with the state of social media’s business models, algorithms, data abuse, and advertising these days so I’m publishing and sharing everything here <a href="https://joshwithers.blog">on the blog first</a>. If you’d like a weekly digest of everything shared here, throw your email into <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/subscribe">the subscribe form here</a>. One day if enough of my community is subscribed here I might even just delete all the social media accounts.</p>

			 <p>A fascinating element of modern web design is that developing/producing for the open web has actually gotten harder, not easier.</p>
<p>I remember the promise of Microsoft FrontPage, Apple&rsquo;s iWeb, Macromedia Dreamweaver, that normal people could just make websites then upload the boring old HTML, CSS, and images to a directory on a web-facing file server and bam you&rsquo;re online.</p>
<p>But today you&rsquo;ve either got Squarespace, Wix, Wordpress.com or installing Wordpress on your own server - but then shit gets weird. Like someone I know was all excited for <a href="https://astro.build">Astro</a> and I look at the website and in the hero image area is the instruction to &ldquo;npm create astro@latest&rdquo; and I have no idea what that means?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the cool and hip web content creator of today?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mess around with anyone over 42, they built different, their families had them formally trained in something by the time they were 2, they had keys to the house by age 5, could cook full meals at 7 and were pretty much self-sufficient at 9.</p>

<p>They left their house at dawn every Summer morning and didn&rsquo;t come back til nightfall and survived all day on water from garden hoses, they might get a sandwich on the off chance somebody&rsquo;s parents had went shopping, they spent three quarters of their lives by themselves with a parent maybe checking on them twice a month, most of them have evaded at least one kidnapping attempt, and, they know 15 different ways to remove blood stains from clothing.

<p>Wear sunscreen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it. The long-term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists, whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience. I will dispense this advice now.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth. Oh, never mind. You will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they&rsquo;ve faded. But trust me, in 20 years, you&rsquo;ll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can&rsquo;t grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked. You are not as fat as you imagine.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about the future. Or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum. The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind, the kind that blindside you at 4 p.m. on some idle Tuesday.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Do one thing every day that scares you.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be reckless with other people&rsquo;s hearts. Don&rsquo;t put up with people who are reckless with yours.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Floss.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t waste your time on jealousy. Sometimes you&rsquo;re ahead, sometimes you&rsquo;re behind. The race is long and, in the end, it&rsquo;s only with yourself.</p>

The owners of the American press, instead, are primarily giving the masses what they want so that owners can become even richer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If actors are getting older and the music we listen to is getting older, it may be because TikTok stars, Twitch streamers, and Roblox creators aren&rsquo;t being counted among entertainers, even if they have a similar-sized audience. One thing that drags down the average age of Fortune 500 executives is when tech startups with young founders go public, but many of those startups don&rsquo;t have the revenue to qualify for the Fortune 500, even if their market cap puts them in the S&amp;P.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is the kicker, this is where the story is going. What we measure isn&rsquo;t always what matters:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Revenue is a lagging measure of impact, just as box office results are an output from fame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What else are we measuring that doesn&rsquo;t matter as much as something we&rsquo;re not measuring at all?</p>

			 <p>Tim Burrowes in <a href="https://www.unmade.media/p/what-we-learned-from-listnr-yesterday?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">Unmade</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The meat of the event came in the panel, which included SCA CEO Grant Blackley. As is regularly the case, he was refreshingly less guarded than most of his peers. He actually told us some of what he was thinking about the company’s future direction.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It included acknowledgement that <strong>the day will come when the transmitters will be turned off</strong>, and all audio is delivered digitally. While an obvious observation, there was a time not so long ago when that would have been sacrilege coming from the person who is also chairman of Commercial Radio Australia.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Slightly to the surprise (I think) of his colleagues, Blackley also confided that he is thinking about making Listnr the main company brand. “One day you might no longer see us called SCA. You might see us called Listnr. I could see a world where if it is in fact at the centre of our universe and it is driving all of our growth and ambitions, and it houses all of our product, maybe there’s a natural extension there… who knows?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He knows. Given that he told the audience he’d made the same point on stage at the Radiodays conference in Europe a few weeks back, I think the answer to that is that he’s already decided.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although this is a very obvious path for the radio industry to take, because it’s where the eyes in the ears and the attention has moved.</p>
<p>The one remaining issue is that as a technology, AM/FM radio, DAB digital radio, and digital television broadcast, are actually quite beautiful technologies.</p>
<p>High definition delivery of audio and visual signals across an entire city and there’s no ISP charging per gigabyte. The only thing required to listen is a simple radio or TV receiver. As much as radio and TV as we know it today will die, it will never go away, I wonder what form it will take in the future?</p>
<p>I wonder what will fill the FM channels in 20 years time?</p>

<p>I’ll always love the radio, it was a beautiful medium in 2009 when this photo of me was taken. Today, the same radio stations are playing the same tune in a different world. That season needs to end, but what does the next look like?</p>

<p>Is Reels even working?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes and no. Reels is now two years old and, according to my reading of the data, it’s only working about half as well as Stories was two years after it launched.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Back in 2018, when Stories was as old as Reels is now, Kevin Systrom was asked about the proportion of time spent in Stories. He declined to give a number but claimed it was “almost just as important” as the main feed. So I’m assuming it was probably somewhere in the 40–50% range.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Reels, on the other hand, only accounts for 20% of time spent—despite the fact that Instagram is pushing it a lot harder. The only thing they did to get us to use Stories was put that little row of circles at the top of our feeds. But now they’re actually sprinkling Reels directly inside our feeds so they’re impossible to ignore. If it was just a little row you could quickly scroll past, I bet that 20% figure would be much lower, perhaps below 10%.</p>

			 <p>As I write this I’m standing in what used to be a seed, or maybe rice, playpen at a local indoor play centre.</p>
<p>Used to be, because this last week they’ve removed the seed/rice and left the floor in this playpen bare like the other areas in the centre. Apparently the upkeep of that one playpen resulted in a whole extra staff member, so the seed pen just wasn’t good for business. They’re now saving a wage, and the business plan</p>
<p>It was good for play, though. My three year old was very worried about its absence, and honestly, it was the main drawcard for this play centre. I’ve never seen it empty, and every toddler in the room desperately wanted to run their fingers through the hundreds of kilograms of other-kid-germ-infected seed. The seeded play pen was good for so many things, just apparently not for business.</p>
<p>This, seemingly, is the art of business. What can I add to my vehicle driving toward our North Star that makes the product or service more valuable, more desirable, more wanted. What can I take away that would not detract from those same elements.</p>
<p>How can we be driving towards our North Star with the least amount of baggage, and the most amount of joy and soul intact?</p>
<p>I wonder if letting that staff member go and removing the rice increased joy, soul, satisfaction in the play centre?</p>
<p>Which makes me think of this line from Mark Zuckerberg of Meta/Facebook/the metaverse this week:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Our north star is can we get a billion people into the metaverse doing hundreds of dollars a piece in digital commerce by the end of the decade? If we do that, we’ll build a business that is as big as our current ad business within this decade. I think that’s a really exciting thing. I think a big part of how you do that is by pushing the open metaverse forward, which is what we’re going to do.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What a soulless and boring North Star. Get back to me when your metaverse has a germ-ridden rice pen, Zuck.</p>

			 <p>The co-founder of podcast host Anchor has written about his perceived issue with podcasting in the <a href="https://mignano.medium.com/the-standards-innovation-paradox-e14cab521391">Standards Innovation Paradox</a>, and James Cridland <a href="https://blog.james.cridland.net/the-standards-innovation-paradox-is-it-real-a1987188c5e9">has responded that it hasn’t remained stagnant in its 19/21 years</a>.</p>
<p>The most prominent issue I see in podcast standards today would be in forming a distinction between a serial show, an episodic show, or a one-off show, like a feature story or a documentary. Serials and episodic shows are covered already in the RSS, but I could see a type of audio story that is a single “episode” of either fiction like a feature film, or a single story like a documentary.</p>

			 <p>Five days after Instagram launched in October 2010 I graced the new photo-sharing service with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/-iO/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=">this gold nugget</a>.</p>
<p>[<img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/359/2022/4d9e6a6ff9.png" alt="Instagram screenshot from October 2010">]
(<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/-iO/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=">https://www.instagram.com/p/-iO/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=</a>)</p>
<p>4,301 days later who knew that I could have summed up the entire social network in four words.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Make me feel better!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instagram made me feel better for the longest time. The simple act of making and viewing photos was lubricated to the point of a simple addiction. I could make photos and share them so easily, and you could share your photos and I could experience them so easily. We would doom scroll wanting to see more of each other&rsquo;s world through the film-filtered Instagram app. Instagram, having stolen from Hipstamatic, did what the hispters never achieved - they made photo sharing easy and beautiful on our new fandangled Apple-branded telephones.</p>
<p>I still remember the early months of Britt and my relationship when she learned about Instagram and when she found out it wasn&rsquo;t available for Android phones we bought her an iPhone. She switched to an iPhone to use a free photo-sharing app.</p>
<p>Making people feel better is the key to success in business, you&rsquo;re solving people&rsquo;s problems, making them feel better. Instagram made us feel so much better.</p>
<p>In the almost 12 years since, the service has adapted new features, like video, IGTV, Stories, and Reels. Each step along that path of evolution has become more and more embarrassing for it.</p>
<p>In 2015 when it adopted Snapchat&rsquo;s Stories feature the theft was seen as an act of survival, and we generally all went along with it. After all, we wanted Stories but didn&rsquo;t want to change to Snapchat and risk getting sexted by some young person along the way.</p>
<p>2018&rsquo;s introduction of IGTV was a hedge against YouTube on mobile. Turns out that portrait/tall video was a few years too early for us.</p>
<p>But in the first year of the Covid pandemic when Instagram replicated TikTok&rsquo;s video service as an Instagram feature called Reels, that&rsquo;s when the social network started losing its soul. The desperation to kill TikTok by replicating, copying, the whole service as a feature has brought us to July 2022 when <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1550171218476781568?s=21&amp;t=MwbGq2mLbegA-BK31fnb_g">the entire app has evolved into an Instagram-shaped TikTok</a>.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a difference between stealing and copying.</p>
<p><a href="https://austinkleon.com/steal/">Great artists steal</a>. When an artist - I&rsquo;m not sure Adam Mosseri would identify as an artist - copies, they replicate, duplicate, they make a facsimile of something else. It lacks soul, and it lacks care. Copying is not what an artist does. Copying is what a lazy corporate slave does.</p>
<p>Stealing, however, is key to being a great artist. If I steal from you, I take your thing and it becomes mine. I take ownership of it. I care for it. It has my attention, it has my soul. Great artists steal. They take your idea and make it their own. If Instagram stole TikTok&rsquo;s video feature, it would look different to Reels. Reels wasn&rsquo;t stolen from TikTok, it was copied.</p>
<p>The easiest way to see if Instagram stole or copied TikTok would be to open the recently updated app and see if it carries the craftsmanship of people who care. Is the user experience beautiful, is it thought through? The content being posted on Instagram as a Reel, does it have a Tiktok watermark on it or is it original content made for Instagram?</p>
<p>Also, what&rsquo;s the deal with some parts of the app being black like a dark mode, and some being white. The recent update is just so poorly implemented.</p>
<p>I often wonder about what the future looks like, and the only data we have to work with is the past. Which major brands, companies, and products ceased to exist in the past - and why? Why am I typing this on a MacBook instead of a Compaq? Why is my phone an iPhone, not a Nokia? Why is my car a Mazda, not a Holden? Why is my internet connection provided by Aussie Broadband, not OzEmail?</p>
<p>For all the P&amp;Ls, corporate mission statements, leadership changes, and org charts, I humbly believe that products/brands/companies that continue to exist, exist because they carry soul and bring purpose into the world, they continue to solve our problems. For all the complaints you can have about Apple Inc., there is a mountain of evidence that the individuals inside the company care about the products they ship. They might have different priorities than you or I, and what they care about might differ from what you&rsquo;d like them to care about, but it is inarguable that they care.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear, without a doubt, that Meta, Mark Zuckerberg, and Adam Mosseri, do not care about Instagram. They care about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21345723/facebook-instagram-documents-emails-mark-zuckerberg-kevin-systrom-hearing">eradicating - or at least neutralising - the competition</a> and now that they can&rsquo;t simply buy their competition, the goal is to strangle them out of the marketplace. Welcome to modern capitalism, and Meta is welcome to engage in it, but I&rsquo;m also at liberty to comment that it&rsquo;s embarrassing and I can&rsquo;t help but feel that this recent copying won&rsquo;t result in the goal they are shooting for.</p>
<p>My friend, Scotty McDonald, accused me of becoming a ratchety old man who doesn&rsquo;t like change, <a href="https://twitter.com/scotty_mcdonald/status/1550395246751924224?s=21&amp;t=MwbGq2mLbegA-BK31fnb_g">tweeting</a>: &ldquo;I remember when you were the fearless, early adopting, shining light in my life&rdquo;. I honestly hope this isn&rsquo;t the beginning of my slide into the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/old-man-yells-at-cloud">old man yells at cloud</a> meme. But that&rsquo;s why I blog, to document my eventual demise into a senile old man who might of had a few correct insights along the way.</p>
<p>Regardless, the July 2022 &ldquo;TikTokfication&rdquo; of Instagram doesn&rsquo;t make me feel better, and that was Instagram&rsquo;s one job.</p>

			 <p>Craig Mod (devastatingly) on travel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The romantic ideal of travel is to leave as one version of yourself and return another, changed, ‘better’ version of yourself. This trip changed me, but not in the ways you might classically expect. I’ve returned suspicious of travel, more confused than ever about why so many people travel. Unsure if most travel of the last few decades makes sense, or has ever made sense or justified the cost. It feels like some consumerist, un-curious notion of travel was seeded long ago and, like a zombie fungus, has mind-controlled everyone to four specific canals in Venice. To a single painting at the Louvre. To three streets and a square in Manhattan. To a few rickety back alleys around Gion. An eminently photogenic set of torii in Kyoto.”</p>

			 <p>This story about Disney - and Hollywood - in China is wild:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The other fascinating part about Disney’s strategy involves the string of English language schools that they opened in the country.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When they were building their theme park in Shanghai, they knew that a child won’t beg their parents to go to a theme park unless they love the characters that they’ll see there. Disney said, “Well, okay, we don’t have decades of movies to do this with.” And they were not allowed [by the Chinese government] to get a Disney Channel onto Chinese airwaves.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So what they decided to do was to launch a string of schools called Disney English, which would essentially teach young Chinese children English, but using Disney characters: Mickey wants an apple, or Luke Skywalker is 30 years old. I walked by one of these schools when I was there, and I remember that Toy Story 4 was coming out that week; all of the teachers were wearing Toy Story 4 T-shirts. So it doubled as a really effective marketing tool as well. Not only did these kids learn the English that their parents wanted them to speak, but they also left with an affection for these Disney characters that they had been introduced to.</p>

			 <p>A few observations on flying out of the Gold Coast this morning.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I departed through a new fancy boarding gate, they have scales in the floor to weigh carry-on stealthily. The new gates are also a bit confusing to reach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for the first time in over 350 flights over 20 years with Qantas my carry-on luggage was weighed and subsequently checked in as luggage, aka taken off me. Which is fine, it’s the rules. But it’s also why professionals fly Qantas, because they won’t touch our carry-on. If that bag doesn’t arrive in Melbourne, I can’t marry a couple this afternoon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Qantas staff seem to be sick and tired of … gestures at everything … and can you blame them?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I had 14kg over two bags and was travelling only carry-on because I have a quick transfer and I’m low on faith in the Sydney and Melbourne baggage handlers. Here’s hoping for luggage success.</p>
<p>Over the microphone one of the crew has announced that it’s great to have us onboard, I’m sure it’s not.</p>

			 <p>Audio is such an intimate medium.</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to catch the final half hour of Laurel, Gary &amp; Mark&rsquo;s final breakfast show on Brisbane&rsquo;s 4KQ. A station with 75 years of history, and a breakfast show that&rsquo;s been on air for 16 years, and one of the hosts has been there for 31 years. It was beautiful hearing the stories and the way the show has impacted lives.</p>
<p>In a world so heavily motivated to move to short-form video the intimacy of audio won’t be long forgotten.</p>
<p>AM and FM radio might have to change business model, but the beauty of audio being freely broadcast across the airwaves will find a new home.</p>
<p>I would posit that one day in the near future someone is going to reinvent audio and it’ll be a game-changer. Podcasts aren’t the final solution - they’re fine but they’re a transition medium not the next medium, nor is Spotify or whatever Apple has at any time. Maybe radio has a hand in it, but some smart person is going to blow our mind with audio in a similar way that TikTok and Reels and YouTube have made impressive gains in video.</p>
<p>And I am here for it.</p>
<p>The audio is dead, long live the audio!</p>

			 <p>This is the weakest take. (See screenshot)</p>
<p>A groom&rsquo;s role in a wedding is in equal nature to the other person being married.</p>
<p>A wedding is not a &ldquo;bride&rsquo;s day&rdquo; or a single person&rsquo;s day.</p>
<p>A wedding is an event hosted by the couple - together, where they actually do get married, but more importantly, they broadcast to their closest friends and family that this is who they are. That people like us, we celebrate and commemorate important things like this. You&rsquo;re erecting a billboard in your community that tells everyone what your values are and what kind of life you are building for yourself and your family.</p>
<p>In this Quora post David is saying that exact thing. When important things happen to him and his wife, he closes his mouth, and doesn&rsquo;t look regretful, so his wife can be happy for just a moment, before she returns to her boring life where she has to put up with this downtrodden husk of a man.</p>
<p>This is the actual real-life manifestation of toxic masculinity.</p>

<p>– @saylor</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a very limited life. Life can be much broader, once you discover one simple fact, and that is that everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you&rsquo;ll never

<p>I miss Away Messages. This nostalgia is layered in abstraction; I probably miss the newness of the internet of the 1990s, and I also miss just being … away. But this is about Away Messages themselves—the bits of code that constructed Maginot Lines around our availability. An Away Message was a text box full of possibilities, a mini-MySpace profile or a Facebook status update years before either existed. It was also a boundary: An Away Message not only popped up as a response after someone IM’d you, it was wholly visible to that person before they IM’d you.</p>

<p>A divide that I would argue isn’t healthy, despite what anyone thinks of Musk - or Trump. Deep cultural and societal divides are unhelpful because the issue stops being the issue, and the divide becomes the issue.</p>

			 <p>We, we the people, reframe and view government as a god. Which is quite unhealthy. We position our prime ministers and presidents as idols, put them on a pedestal, and expect a lot from them.</p>
<p>Ultimately, those positions - from the top to the bottom of the organisation chart - are not gods, they are servants. They serve our community. We render a select number of social services to this service provider and ask them to look after them. We&rsquo;re talking roads, border control, hospitals, those dinky little health brochures, and everything in between.</p>
<p>We essentially outsource all these things to the state, federal, and local governments. This is great because I don’t want to be responsible for maintaining roads, bringing justice to situations, or manning the borders.</p>
<p>In doing this we are making the same choice the Israelites made when they asked Samuel for a king. So we get a king and we “render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar&rsquo;s, and unto God the things that are God’s”.</p>
<p>Not everything is the government’s job. They are not a god, or God and some things shouldn’t be outsourced to the government.</p>
<p>Abortion, for example, I see abortion as a symptom of an unwell society. If abortion is occurring and it is unsafe then there should be safety regulations around it, but ultimately these laws or regulations are just bumper bars on the ten pin bowling alleyway.</p>
<p>When you are unwell, you don’t treat the symptoms, you treat the cause.</p>
<p>What is the cause of abortion? Who are these people wanting/having abortions? Do they really actually want an abortion, or would they have a child if the circumstances were different, either residentially, financially, or relationally? Maybe if they weren&rsquo;t abused or tricked, they would want to become a parent?</p>
<p>Maybe there are people who genuinely want an abortion. Perhaps the baby is the unplanned result of a sexual encounter, what life are they leading where they want this? Surely there is something below the surface? A pattern of abuse, sexual or otherwise, that lead them to this place? Surely if families weren&rsquo;t broken, and if we were vulnerable with each other, if we had tighter communities, we wouldn&rsquo;t be reaching this endpoint?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a middle-aged white guy, so I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve missed a case for abortion, but I struggle to believe that anything more than a few people are genuinely out there &ldquo;murdering babies&rdquo; with murderous intent. I imagine that most, almost all, would be regretful and mournful but seemingly without choice and between a rock and a hard place.</p>
<p>Legislation, machine-learning, artificial intelligence, and even Ceasar (the government), don’t know how to deal with complex issues like abortion, because they are human issues, with complex routing, complex incentives, responsibilities, and longterm effects.</p>
<p>But in his grace and glory, Christ does, and his ambassadors can. Let us render unto God what is God’s.</p>
<p>This position will anger pro-abortion and anti-abortion people because it actually requires you to care, listen, and lean in. It might even require some of your money or your resources. People aren’t ready to take personal responsibility for it.</p>
<p>But as Samuel warned the Israelites:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;These will be the ways of the king who will reign over you: he will take your sons and appoint them to his chariots and to be his horsemen to run before his chariots; and he will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and some to plow his ground and to reap his harvest, and make his implements of war and the equipment of his chariots. He will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers. He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive orchards and give them to his courtiers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kings can be real bitches.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to the voice of the people in all that they say to you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me from being king over them&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If I can end on a real note, I really struggle when Christians get so excited about governments, electing the right governments, having the right kings, and I’m like, you read 1 Samuel mate?</p>

			 <p>Ok, I’m a little bit sad because the Internet is changing and I don’t like it.</p>
<p>My favourite thing to create outside of marriage ceremonies, are photos. Video is fine, but there’s something so beautifully finite about a photo.</p>
<p>A photo says everything it wants to say and no more. You don’t need volume up, and you can give it as much attention as you like. You’re not forced to spend a certain amount of time on it. You can spend all day looking at and thinking about a still photo, or half a second.</p>
<p>The medium requires nothing, but everything off you. You can just as easily swipe past it as much as it can change your life.</p>
<p>High quality and colour graded is nice, but I think about the first computer I owned. The entire screen was 640 pixels wide, and 480 pixels high, and each pixel could be one of 256 colours. Nothing fancy, but I saw photos that changed me on that screen.</p>
<p>So Instagram, Facebook, and Meta are pretty much moving away from still photos. Recent changes mean the entire company is deprioritising photos and prioritising Reels. Think about the last time you saw something on a Meta platform that wasn’t a moving picture.</p>
<p>So if we want to stay in touch, it’s gotta be over video. Unless you’re on somewhere cool like Twitter, Glass, or Micro.Blog I guess.</p>
<p>Video killed the photograph star.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A friend asked “Thoughts on Musk Twitter?” in a message, I replied, and thought, that should be a blog post:</p>
<p>The man’s not an idiot, and Twitter hasn’t thrived as a public company. He’s one of the few people who could buy it without antitrust issues whilst also actually uses the actual product and has an interest in it.</p>
<p>I reckon it’s a potential net-positive.</p>
<p>Worst case scenario: Twitter fades into obscurity as it has been for a while.</p>
<p>Best case scenario: Maybe there’s a social media platform with a better platform than “we know everything about you and use that to sell ads.”</p>
<p>As for the people who think Elon could of spent the money better, spending other people’s money is easy, spend your own on charity.</p>

			 <p>If I’m making photographs for fun - aka not for money - I’m often shooting with a 41 year old lens that was passed on to me from my aunty, a Minolta MD 50mm f2 strapped onto the front of my Canon EOS R5.</p>
<p>There’s nothing technically special about the lens, but I love that it’s seen so much of the world. Plus I like the images it makes</p>
<p>But because it&rsquo;s a manual focus only lens, it&rsquo;s a nice trick if any images are in focus.</p>
<p>Recently started playing with Topaz Sharpen AI and that software really helps me where my manually focusing fingers fail me.</p>

Perhaps I could forgive the label for being so far from the geographic center of Brooklyn if the intersection of Brooklyn Ave and Atlantic Ave were at all remarkable. But no it’s just a random intersection along the A/C line with a 7/11 that the Google Maps label for Brooklyn just so happens to be positioned directly on top of.  Why not just put it in the actual center of the borough? What purpose does this serve? Who or what algorithm is responsible? I descended a rabbit hole.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>There was a really well known wedding photographer who was talking to Britt about shooting for The Elopement Collective, and on the phone to her (my wife) he told her that he hopes she fails in business along with some other rude things.</p>
<p>Not long after that phone call there was a dress up wedding industry Halloween party that I knew he would be going to, so I attended in the hopes of confronting him at the event, possibly even punching him.</p>
<p>The good news for all is that not only do I not really punch people, but on arrival to the event I realised how stupid it would be to publicly assault someone to defend my wife&rsquo;s honour.</p>
<p>He is still a douche - always will be - and my wife is always worth protecting, defending, fighting for. But assaulting him isn&rsquo;t the answer.</p>
<p>Instead we send him glitter in the mail every now and then. Plus when people want to hire him I tell them how mean and horrible he is and he doesn’t get the booking.</p>
<p>What Chris Rock said was horrible. What Will Smith did was worse.</p>

It operates autonomously, allowing the driver to select atmospheric or action-filled sequences. When the O₂ is parked, videos can be edited and shared directly from the centre display. Deploy the drone. Document the drive. And capture the fun of premium electric performance.”</p>

			 <p><a href="https://every.to/divinations/substack-s-ideology">Substack’s idealogy</a> by Nathan Baschez in <strong>Every</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The history of modern publishing (can be traced) back to the decision in 1833 of a guy named Benjamin Day to offer his newspaper, The New York Sun, for a sixth the price of his competition.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>His strategy was to focus on sensational journalism to get broad reach, and make up for the losses in subscription revenue through advertising.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That model has dominated media to this day, except it’s now broken, because Facebook and Google and Craigslist took all the advertising revenue.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The answer is to build a new ecosystem where individual writers or small teams offer hyper-focused subscription products that add genuine value to readers&rsquo; lives, rather than merely trying to trick them into clicking.</strong>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What a novel idea. News media that adds value instead of tricking people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“We believe that journalistic content has intrinsic value and that it doesn’t have to be given away for free. We believe that what you read matters. And we believe that there has never been a better time to bolster and protect those ideals. Now, more than ever, publishers of news and similar content can be profitable through direct payments from readers. In fact, we are so convinced by this notion that we have started a company to accelerate the advent of what we are convinced will be a new golden age for publishing. The company is called Substack.”</em></p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about the current disaster situation north and south of our home in flood devastated areas and how &ldquo;the government&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t doing anything. I don&rsquo;t think I want a government to do things. Governments have historically not achieved anything close to what regular people have.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like you and I to do things, instead of putting our faith in a bureaucracy structured around a democratic election. The incentives are out of whack, and our want for &ldquo;them&rdquo; to do something doesn&rsquo;t help the political process. It gives them easy wins by promising money but not delivering, and easy opportunities for a photo and a handshake whilst helping no-one.</p>
<p>I think it would be much more powerful for our communities to find their common unities, for those communities to band together with finances, services, love, care, hugs, cooking, whatever is needed. Not to wait for a old white guy in the capital city to help us, for us to help ourselves. Outsourcing care to those people gets us nowhere except for more taxes and less care with less help.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been outsourcing caring to government for too long. They don&rsquo;t do it well.</p>
<p>We asked the government to look after our poor and we got Centrelink&rsquo;s robodebt. We asked the government to look after our health and we got the last two years of whatever 2020-2021-2022 was. We asked the government to look after our financials and we got the GFC, current house prices, and ZIRP (zero interest rate policy). We asked the government to regulate the media and we got nightly news bulletins that somehow are the same length every night, and newspapers that hold power in government, not holding government to account. We asked the government to come and help in the floods and we got a PR and social media marketing campaign. We asked the government to lead and we got Scotty from marketing.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s stop asking the government to do things, and ask ourselves to do things, ask each other to do things. It might be scary, but let&rsquo;s be vulnerable, let&rsquo;s ask for help. Let&rsquo;s be real.</p>
<p>The government is good at building roads and collecting rubbish. The government isn&rsquo;t good at care, love, or help.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Sixty percent of IKEA purchases are impulse buys. And IKEA’s own creative director has said that only 20% of the store’s purchases are based on actual logic and needs.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How does IKEA trick you into buying more stuff? (1) Store layout.  Inside, customers are led through a preordained, one-way path that winds through 50-plus room settings. The average IKEA store is 300k sq. ft.—the equivalent of about five football fields—and their typical shopper ends up walking almost a mile. This forces wider product exposure, creates a false sense of scarcity and creates mystery. (2) Low prices. IKEA often follows a “price first, design later” philosophy: It starts with a price target—say $6.99 for a new stool—then reverse-engineers the design process to meet that goal. IKEA seems to adhere to a “survival of the fittest” pricing model: If a product’s price can’t be reduced over time, it tends to get discontinued. (3) The IKEA Effect. We have a cognitive bias wherein we place a higher value on items we build ourselves, regardless of the quality of the end result. (4) Cafeteria. A survey of 700 shoppers found that those who ate at the food court spent an average of more than two times more on home furnishings than those who didn’t.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>From this week&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.densediscovery.com/issues/175">Dense Discovery email</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When looking at older portraits (first painted, then photographed) you would notice that very few subjects smile. As this piece explains, up to the beginning of the 20th century, “a grin was only characteristic of peasants, drunkards, children, and halfwits”. In the first half of the 21st century, camera company Kodak tried to make the experience of having your photo taken less awkward and more fun, and thus created a marketing campaign to emphasise the pleasure of photography. The photographic smile became a byproduct of an increasingly sophisticated advertising culture focused on telling cheerful stories about products.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Humans don’t desire anything independently. Human desire is mimetic – we imitate what other people want. This affects the way we choose partners, friends, careers, clothes, and vacation destinations. Mimetic desire is responsible for the formation of our very identities. It explains the enduring relevancy of Shakespeare’s plays, why Peter Thiel decided to be the first investor in Facebook, and why our world is growing more divided as it becomes more connected.”</p>

			 <p><em>A text message I thought was worth sharing as a blog post:</em></p>
<p>First stop, I reckon you need to get into a camera. Look at a Fuji X100 or a Sony RX100 as a start.</p>
<p>Secondly, have you figured out your travel kit? For a trip like this, with a kid, I’d urge you to not take a laptop, maybe an iPad, and to work out a charging solution like an Anker multi-port
USB/USB-C charger with an international plug on it.</p>
<p>Thirdly, have you chosen a travel cot and travel pram? The BabyZen YoYo travel pram is a cool glass of water in hell. You’ll give me a sainthood for making you buy one. Choosing a travel cot is tricky, we have the Phil &amp; Ted’s which packs smaller, but the BabyBjorn and the new Bugaboo travel cots are still small but much quicker setup. Choose your poison.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Basically, there’ll be lots of dragging this stuff around, particularly in Venice where you have to carry everything, so take as little as possible.</p>
<p>Have you phoned Qantas to request a bassinet seat?</p>
<p>Here’s my city tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>London</strong>: get into the palace and take out Prince Andrew.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Oxford</strong>: get an education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Paris</strong>: have as many Nutella crepes as you can physically stomach and do the Big Red Bus tours, buy your wife nice things in the nice shops so that when you’re home and you have forty kids you can look at that nice sweater and remember that time you travelled the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Berlin</strong>: do a walking tour or two, the real Berlin is seen from street level, learn about the pedestrian crossing lights, look for bullet holes in the side of buildings, be surprised at the location where Hitler died, walk into every cool shop just because it’s cool, visit Computerspiele Museum - the computer game museum - it’s a lot of fun, stand in awe at the monuments, memorials, and existing parts of the wall. It’ll move you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless of course you mean Bern in Switzerland in which case I have no idea. Same for Lauterbrunnen. I did not know these places existed until I googled them wondering if you didn’t mean Berlin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Venice</strong>, I hear it’s lovely, but get up to Santa Monica while you’re there. Seriously though, I don’t know. Apparently you need to walk everywhere in the Italian version so pack light.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Florence</strong>: Get out into the regions, like San Gimignano, Siena, or Chianti or so many others, just get in a car and go. Italy’s regional areas are the opposite of Australia’s regional areas, which is to say, they’re really good. The main surprise is that they eat late and they don’t understand the concept of takeaway food, which is great if you’ve got a crying baby. That said, feel free to pass her off to a nonna for a hug, this also applies to bub.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rome</strong>: There’s a small handful of landmarks you’ll probably recognise when you Google the town name, but my tip is to never eat in a palazzo. They’re full of tourists and bad food. There’s so many great restaurants there, but you have go to Trattoria Der Pallaro purely for the experience. Visit the Via del Corso Apple Store because its beautiful.</p>
</li>
</ul>

			 <p>The Final Comeback of Axl Rose, by John Jeremiah Sullivan in 2006, referenced in the Rubesletter by Matt Ruby, today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Axl has said, &ldquo;I sing in five or six different voices that are all part of me. It&rsquo;s not contrived.&rdquo; I agree. One of them is an unexpectedly competent baritone. The most important of the voices, though, is Devil Woman. Devil Woman comes from a deeper part of Axl than do any of the other voices. Often she will not enter until nearer the end of a song. In fact, the dramatic conflict between Devil Woman and her sweet, melodic yang—the Axl who sings such lines as Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place and If you want to love me, then darling, don&rsquo;t refrain and Sometimes I get so tense—is precisely what resulted in Guns N&rsquo; Roses&rsquo; greatest songs…</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And what does she say, this Devil Woman? What does she always say, for that matter? Have you ever thought about it? I hadn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;Sweet Child,&rdquo; &ldquo;Paradise City,&rdquo; &ldquo;November Rain,&rdquo; &ldquo;Patience,&rdquo; they all come down to codas—Axl was a poet of the dark, unresolved coda—and to what do these codas themselves come down? Everybody needs somebody. Don&rsquo;t you think that you need someone? I need you. Oh, I need you. Where do we go? Where do we go now? Where do we go? I wanna go. Oh, won&rsquo;t you please take me home?</p>

			 <p>&ldquo;When rain falls, it flows downhill. If desired, you can collect the rain in a bucket and carry it uphill, but the natural tendency of water is to flow toward the lowest point.</p>
<p>Most situations in life have a tendency—a direction in which things want to flow. You can choose to go against the flow (just as you can choose to carry water uphill), but your results tend to be better when you find a way to work with the gradient of the situation.</p>
<p>Position yourself to benefit from the external forces at hand and you will get more from the same unit of effort. Energy is conserved and results are multiplied.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>At a wedding recently I heard my mate <a href="http://www.chrishutchisonweddings.com">Hutcho</a> belt out an old school banger with more energy and passion than the original artist could of. I jokingly asked afterward, &ldquo;why do people make new music?&rdquo; There is so much good music, how do you even get the guts to release a new song and meekly tell the world that you&rsquo;ve made new music despite there being so much good music.</p>
<p>Then once you actually make new music, you&rsquo;re hoping that the algorithmically-driven music industry today accepts your offering and feeds it to the masses, so much so that you can put food on the table.</p>
<p>Then I read about the actual state of the music industry. <a href="https://tedgioia.substack.com/p/is-old-music-killing-new-music">Ted Gioia writes a few days ago</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;All the growth in the market is coming from old songs. The 200 most popular tracks now account for less than 5% of total streams.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And if you enjoy reading about the death, and rebirth, of pop, you should read <a href="https://adamsinger.substack.com/p/pop-is-dead-and-no-one-cares">Adam Singer as well.</a>.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve upgraded my MacBook this week to a new MacBook Pro, and a friend asked me how it was.</p>
<p>I said it&rsquo;s unnoticeable, like a good marriage celebrant, or a good real estate agent should be. That good that you don&rsquo;t notice.</p>
<p>When your computer is slow you notice, and you moan about it. When your celebrant isn&rsquo;t confident and delivering a great ceremony, you notice it and joke about it at the reception, and when your real estate agent is a dodgy one, you really notice, and tell all your mates.</p>
<p>My hope is that I&rsquo;m that good that you don&rsquo;t notice. That I&rsquo;d be like my new MacBook, so fast, efficient, and plain old good, that you don&rsquo;t notice how good until you think about all the other computers you&rsquo;ve used and you realise you&rsquo;ve got a real powerhouse of a computer in front of you.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As soon as you decide to do without planes, you realise how they impose their limited way of looking at things on you. Oh, they diminish distances, which is handy enough, but they end up diminishing everything including your understanding of the world. You leave Rome at sunset, have dinner, sleep a while, and at dawn you are in India. But in reality each country has its own special character. We need time if we are to prepare ourselves for the encounter; we must make an effort if we are to enjoy the conquest. Everything has become so easy that we no longer take pleasure in anything. To understand is a joy but only if it comes with effort, and nowhere is this more than in the experience of other countries. Reading a guidebook while hopping from one airport to another is not the same as the slow, laborious absorption- as if by osmosis- of the humours of the earth to which ones remains bound when travelling by train.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Reached by plane, all places become alike- destinations separated from one another by nothing more than a few hours flight. Frontiers, created by nature and history and roots in the consciousness of the people who live within them, lose their meaning &amp; cease to exist for those who travel to and from the air-conditioned bubbles of airports, where the border is a policeman in front of a computer screen where the first encounter with the new place is baggage carousel, where the emotion of leave taking is dissipated in the rush to get to the duty free shop- now the same everywhere&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Over the past year, Mr. Williamson, a fifth-generation Mackay local, has tried more outreach and education, meeting frequently with residents to discuss why the trees are needed, and whether a lighter mix of vegetation might be allowed for partial ocean views.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If Mackay was going to be in the New York Times I always thought it would be because they ship about 100 million tonnes of coal out of the region every year.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With all the conversation of breaking free from big social platforms, owning your own digital identity, and being independent, I have been asking myself: how can all of us who have slowly become online performance artists ever be post-social?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since March 2020 I&rsquo;ve thought a lot about what it means for us to think we&rsquo;re so self-important and what that means for us living in a community with a virus like the spicy cough.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not only me, but the moment a sense of self-importance enters my soul I start feeling sick. This photo of a chicken with a mullet often helps me get over myself.</p>

			 <p>Today, on the 683rd day of March 2020, we won our first Covid wedding cancellation court case, a court hearing I attended from the carpark of a service station in Maryborough which had erected a statue of Ned Kelly in front of it. A weird culmination.</p>
<p>The first six were frustrated contracts which meant the contract was basically torn up and the judge had to make a decision as if they were a &ldquo;man on the Clapham omnibus&rdquo; which is pretty much the common law definition of the pub test.</p>
<p>Today, our contract stood up and was not frustrated, and the couple had cancelled the contract.</p>
<p>So the real winner in this pandemic is my original lawyer, who I fired after his legal advice when people started cancelling was for us to just refund everyone, something we couldn&rsquo;t afford to do.</p>
<p>Wedding vendors are not wedding insurance, but for the past 683 days we&rsquo;ve been treated like it.</p>

			 <p>The most disappointing element of modern society is the insistence that all stories (including the news, and celebrity or sport stories) must be completed as soon as possible so we can establish tribal battle lines and figure out if our tribe is winning or losing.</p>
<p>Most stories require hours, if not weeks, or years to bake in the story oven.</p>
<p>It’s highly likely that the stories you’re reading or hearing are actually half-baked and require a lot more time in the oven.</p>
<p>Reject half-baked stories. Reject the need for every story to have a tweet or post attached to it. Embrace slow stories where the storyteller has spent time researching, listening, asking, and they’re delivering a well baked story.</p>

<p>A good model is Peacock-WWE. Last March, NBC Universal took over the pro wrestling outfit’s WWE Network and its 1.1. million subs, offering them a deal on Peacock for their Roman Reigns fix. Check out these internal Peacock stats that came to me from a source:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Of the 1.1 million subscribers to WWE Network, one million successfully converted to Peacock subscribers.</li>
<li>More than 3 million Peacock subs have watched WWE content since it moved over in March.</li>
<li>More than half of those 3 million subs indicated that they signed up “because of WWE.”</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Rights and branding issues are thorny, but consolidation makes sense, even if it’s not a major merger like Comcast or Netflix or Roku picking off Lionsgate/Starz, or some of the other buzzed-about potential deals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wonder what Australian consolidation we could see?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way that Youtube, Amazon, Netflix, Disney, or Apple will cede their position or brand, and maybe they could suck some streaming providers in. Viacom CBS seems set on playing the long game so they could be in the same lineup as the big five.</p>
<p>That leaves SBS, ABC, Seven, Nine, Telstra, Stan, Kayo, Binge, Foxtel, Hayu, Optus Sport in the Australian market wanting credentials or money, and HBO Max, Hulu, Peacock, Fubo/ESPN not in the market &hellip; yet?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s left in 2025? Is there room for 20 subscriptions? Potentially $200 a month on TV.</p>

Not just to endure it, not just to suffer it, not just to pass through it, but to live in it. To look at it. To try to get the picture. To live recklessly. To take chances. To make your own work and take pride in it. To seize the moment. And if you ask me why you should bother to do that, I could tell you that the grave’s a fine and private place, but none I think do there embrace. Nor do they sing there, or write, or argue, or see the tidal bore on the Amazon, or touch their children. And that’s what there is to do and get it while you can and good luck at it.”</p>

			 <p>A letter to a newborn child, requested of Desmond Tutu by the girl’s father, July 2016:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Juliet</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello, little sister.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You don’t know me. I am a very old grandfather from South Africa nearing the end of my journey on earth while your journey—on another continent many miles away—is just beginning. We may never meet on earth, so I thought to send you a secret. Well, it’s not really a secret because we should all know it. So I don’t mind if you tell everyone else.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Did you know that all people belong to one family, the human family? That although we may look nothing like each other, live in separate homes, practise our own cultures, subscribe to different religions—and some of us have more money than others—we are all sisters and brothers of God’s family?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You and I, and everyone else, were born with the same purpose. For love, for goodness and for one another.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>God Bless You.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Cape Town, South Africa</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know it’s normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile.</p>

			 <p>Why people hate their email but also why they should love it.</p>
<p>I think it’s a crime that not many people subscribe to <a href="https://thesizzle.com.au">The Sizzle</a>. The idea of paying $5 a month for it still scares lots of people away. Which is crazy, because for $5 you get immense value from the desk of @decryption. I referred my mate Nick to The Sizzle and he said &ldquo;The Sizzle is one of the best things I regularly read. Can’t believe I didn’t know about it til now.&rdquo; In that group chat another friend replied &ldquo;Most people hate email. That’s a huge hurdle.&rdquo; Which is true, but I have a theory about email.</p>
<p>People saying they hate email is like people that say they hate church. There’s actually nothing wrong with church as a building, an idea, the gospel as a whole is a good guide for living, it&rsquo;s just that some people have majorly abused elements of church. Seriously, please stop, Christians. So should we burn church as a concept to the ground? Churches don’t kill people, people kill people. Or something like that. Should we burn email to the ground?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the &ldquo;burning email to the ground&rdquo; note, a <a href="https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/042">recent episode of Hemispheric Views interviewed Rob from Fastmail</a> on the topic /cc <a href="https://micro.blog/hemisphericviews">@hemisphericviews</a> <a href="https://micro.blog/canion">@canion</a> <a href="https://micro.blog/martinfeld">@martinfeld</a> <a href="https://micro.blog/burk">@burk</a></p>

<p>IMHO it&rsquo;s the same with email, emails aren&rsquo;t bad, but the way people use email can be bad.</p>
<p>I look at my mate Ash&rsquo;s iPhone screen and see the red badge on his email app and it terrifies me. What&rsquo;s the current unread count, Ash? The thing is, most people don’t love their inbox because it’s their internet yard … and most people don’t like looking after their own backyard.</p>
<p>They like going to restaurants where waiters bring the food and take away dirty dishes. We like going to public parks where the council mows the lawn. We love theme parks where the employees maintain the rides. In this analogy, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Apple News, LinkedIn, Snapchat, TikTok, are the third parties.</p>
<p>It turns out our homes &amp; our yards are pretty cool, we just need to invest into them, maintain them, clean them, and if we do, we might enjoy living in them, and we can do whatever we like there because it’s our backyard.</p>
<p>Email is the backyard of the internet. Your inbox is yours, you own it, and most of us leave it to rot because it’s not on public display and most people won’t see it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Hit the unsubscribe button on as many emails as you can. Be brutal, if you miss it, you can go back and resubscribe, but you don&rsquo;t let just anyone camp in your backyard.</li>
<li>Have a personal inbox, hopefully on your own domain, so you&rsquo;re not beholden to a big tech provider. I recommend Fastmail, or for my personal email I use iCloud/MobileMe/.Mac, I have for maybe 14 years.</li>
<li>Separate work and personal. Get personal emails in your personal inbox, work in your work inbox. Don&rsquo;t look at your work inbox if you&rsquo;re not working.</li>
<li>Explore other email apps, technologies, and plugins, like Spark or Sanebox.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.relay.fm/mpu/539">Listen to this episode of Mac Power Users</a> to get a little jumpstart on email.</li>
<li>Regularly check your spam fodler and mark as not junk or move it to your inbox so the junk mail filter learns what is good and bad. On GMail learn how to use the Promotional tabs etc, and even disable them if you like.</li>
<li>Actively look for emails to subscribe to. If you do have emails you love to receive, share them as a reply to this so others can experience the joy of receiving good, nice, helpful, relevant emails in their inbox.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://joshwithers.blog/inputs/#email">Here&rsquo;s my mostly up to date list of emails I subscribe to.</a></p>
<p>Email is one of the few agnostic, device-independent, big-tech-independent, communication channels that you can easily and lovingly own. Learn to love it. Mow your internet backyard, and maybe even do some landscaping.</p>

			 <p>The past two years has rocked us to the very core financially, mentally, emotionally, and to think it&rsquo;s still not over yet. We&rsquo;ve been trying to keep moving towards our north star of not being old, grumpy, tired, burnt out, angry, people that the old panny-demmy ruined. That&rsquo;s not the news, that&rsquo;s just me setting the scene.</p>
<h2 id="1-new-job">1. New job!</h2>
<p>The main news is that I&rsquo;m diversifying my career and I&rsquo;ve taken an opportunity to join the team at Harcourts Property Centre and over the next season I&rsquo;ll be training and learning how to be a gun real estate nerd. Britt and I have bought two homes and sold one so I have some opinions on how I think I could bring a Josh-like-vibe to the real estate game.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually really excited about my future career placing people in their new home. On that note, getting new listings is the hard work in real estate. I plan on being authentic on that journey, but if you&rsquo;re local to me and looking to sell, call a brother ;)</p>
<h2 id="2-still-creating-marriage-ceremonies">2. Still creating marriage ceremonies!</h2>
<p>As far as weddings and elopements go, nothing is changing. Anyone who has me booked in, we&rsquo;re all still good to go. Nothing to stress about, I am still your celebrant. Could you imagine finding out the opposite on social media?!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll still take new wedding bookings into the future, but maybe less, and probably more local. I&rsquo;ve lost more money to airlines, Airbnb&rsquo;s, and hotels in the last two years than most people have spent so I&rsquo;m fairly gun-shy about gallivanting around the universe in the near future. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m adding real estate to my resume, because I think I can do a great job, and it tends to be a little closer to home.</p>
<p>Want me to be your celebrant? <a href="https://withers.co/celebrant">withers.co/celebrant</a></p>
<h2 id="3-about-this-instagram-account">3. About this instagram account!</h2>
<p>So [my wedding Instagram page, <a href="https://micro.blog/hellojoshwithers">@hellojoshwithers</a>](<a href="https://instagram.com/hellojoshwithers">https://instagram.com/hellojoshwithers</a>) will broaden out and I&rsquo;ll share my weddings, elopements, family, and real estate story; and my old personal Instagram, I&rsquo;ve decided to start sharing my love for the better end of the Gold Coast, the GC south of Talle&rsquo; so I&rsquo;ve renamed that account @southoftalle.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been making photos for more local businesses and myself recently, if you&rsquo;d like some photos of your business or home get in touch at <a href="https://withers.co/josh">withers.co/josh</a></p>
<h2 id="4-about-southoftalle">4. About @southoftalle!</h2>
<p>About four years ago our family made the move south of the border, that is, the border to the Southern Gold Coast: Tallebudgera Creek. I was a proud North Gold Coaster but Tugun, Palm Beach, Currumbin, Cooly, Snapper, all won my heart.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a storyteller at heart and I want to tell the story of the better end of the Gold Coast, the GC south of Talle&rsquo;. So I&rsquo;ve converted my old &ldquo;here&rsquo;s random photos of stuff&rdquo; Instagram account to <a href="https://instagram.com/southoftalle">@southoftalle</a> and started <a href="http://email.southoftalle.com.au">an email newsletter, sharing the stories of the Southern Gold Coast</a>. I&rsquo;d actually love to work that old radio muscle and podcast with my neighbours down here, other entrepreneurs, and locals that have a cool story, like the bloke that plays the didgeridoo at Snapper Rocks. So if you want to fall in love with the promise land south of the Tallebudgera Creek, give me a follow over at <a href="https://instagram.com/southoftalle">@southoftalle</a> and <a href="http://email.southoftalle.com.au">throw your email address in here</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m keen to get my new drone up, and to fire up my camera, and share my &lsquo;hood.</p>
<h2 id="5-britts-making-photos-of-families-and-couples">5. Britt&rsquo;s making photos of families and couples!</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m super proud of Britt, she&rsquo;s picked up the camera and started making photos that really rock families and couples&rsquo; world - she&rsquo;s sharing them over at <a href="https://instagram.com/brittanywithersphoto">@brittanywithersphoto</a> and you can book her in at <a href="https://withers.co/britt">withers.co/britt</a>.</p>

			 <p>A friend, hi Andy, was talking  about business and investment opportunities in the coming years. I blurted this out as a text message but thought I might record it here on my blog to look back on in 8 years time.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>The 2020’s - in Australia and the western world - Will be marked by a couple of significant factors.</p>
<p>– Number one will be high interest rate policy, HIRP, after a decade of low interest-rate policy, LIRP, interest rates will start to rise and this is going to change a lot of things economically - hopefully positively - for the world. My uneducated guess is that it’s going to be a time of slightly more wealth distribution. Low interest-rate policy takes the wealth out of the centre, high interest policy will spread it around more and create more opportunities financially.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Secondly, there will be a very significant change in the mindsets of people to live for the moment. This means short-term gratification, short-term wins, short-term growth, will be favourable and long-term success will be less popular. There are opportunities here to take advantage of those people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thirdly, experiences like travel and other in person experiences will have a very high growth rate after we’ve been locked up for a while. We want and need to connect with our history, our people, our families and friends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, media and communication, social networks, and how we use technology to live, is going to change dramatically with a shift away from Facebook and Google and Microsoft, and there will be a move towards deeper online experiences in smaller niche communities. This is another real opportunity for investment and growth. A good example of this is the company unity who is listed in America under the stock code U. They just purchased Weta in NZ and that positions them amazingly to creat in real time 3D worlds, entertainment experiences like a movie or TV show, and of course games which I already involved in. In the past where you would think of an idea like a TV show and then you would write it, and then you would have to cast and film it. In the future with technology like unity is working on your then just program the script into the system and then you’ll have a TV show. So many massive opportunities in how we experience life and entertainment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One bonus point: weed. As that’s decriminalised there’s big opportunities imho.</p>

<p>Whenever you find yourself thinking you’re late to a new technological trend, remember that Walt Disney thought he was late to animation in 1923.
​
On the same theme, Marc Andreessen thought he’d missed the Silicon Valley boom when he arrived in 1994. He said: “My big feeling was I just missed it, I missed the whole thing. It had happened in the ‘80s, and I got here too late.”

			 <p>You’ve probably heard about <a href="https://tvblackbox.com.au/page/2021/11/21/two-week-suspension-for-matt-doran-after-poorly-researched-adele-blunder/">Seven’s Matt Doran’s not listening to Adele’s new album before interviewing her</a>. Classic “you had one job” kinda material. I’m not defending Matt, but I’ve got three embarrassing celebrity interview stories of my own from my time on radio if you’d like to hear them?</p>
<p>Story number one was my first interview with someone famous. Not my first conversation, that was with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_(musician)">Diesel</a>, aka Johnny Diesel, as I answered the call in the 4CRM reception and put it through to the announcer on air. This first story is about <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tism">TISM</a>.</p>
<p>TISM had just released 2004&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Albun">The White Albun</a> was described to The Age as &ldquo;basically what Jet are doing, which is taking The Beatles ideas and changing them a little bit at the end. If it&rsquo;s worked for Jet, it&rsquo;s going to work for us, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re hoping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their record company had emailed out opportunities for phone interviews and I, volunteer aspiring radio announcer at <a href="https://4crm.com.au/">107.5 FM Stereo 4CRM Community Radio Mackay</a> keenly replied in the affirmative.</p>
<p>At the allotted time the phone rings, I put the phone in the second studio in speakerphone mode, point a microphone at that speaker, decide not to wear headphones, click record on the Sony MiniDisc recorder, and answer the call.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my first phone interview, I&rsquo;m nervous as hell, I have lost my paper notes, and I&rsquo;ve forgotten the name of the person I&rsquo;m interviewing. I think on my feet and pretend that we&rsquo;re live on air. My thought is that I can make out like we&rsquo;re live and get them to tell me their name.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Minack">Ron Hitler-Barassi</a> is a smart man and he senses my screwup. He&rsquo;s got his notes. He interrupts my spiel about how I&rsquo;ve got my good mate from TISM on them phone and I&rsquo;d like them to introduce themselves to my (very small) audience.</p>
<p>Ron Hitler-Barassi says &ldquo;if we&rsquo;re such good friends Joshua Withers from 4CRM Mackay, why don&rsquo;t you introduce me to everyone listening.&rdquo; The interview is me stumbling over myself the whole time and it&rsquo;s terrible.</p>
<p>Luckily because I wasn&rsquo;t wearing studio headphones I couldn&rsquo;t hear that I had left the horse racing satellite channel up and the interview was me, Ron Hitler-Barassi, and the horse racing. Sadly lost to the archives.</p>
<p>The second story is from a few years later when I&rsquo;d gotten a paid job in commercial radio - as a broadcast engineer/nerd/IT guy for Sea FM on the Gold Coast - but I actually wanted to be on air so I was volunteering hosting breakfast at the station now called <a href="https://juice1073.com.au/">Juice 107.3FM</a>.</p>
<p>It was really running me down, on air from 6am to 9am as a volunteer and then working a full-time job after. Tired does not begin to describe my state of being. This morning I&rsquo;d gotten off air, forgot I had a phone interview, and fell asleep on a couch.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m asleep, and the radio station receptionist wakes me up and tells me that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Sebastian">Guy Sebastian</a> is on hold for me.</p>
<p>I remember that I was supposed to listen to his new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Memphis_Album">Memphis album</a>, and I was supposed to have researched his motives behind recording the album, and what it all meant - I had done none of this.</p>
<p>Fudged the whole interview, revealed to Guy Sebastian that I hadn&rsquo;t listened to the album, didn&rsquo;t know what Memphis music was like, and I was a fish out of water. Guy&rsquo;s management banned me from doing future phone interviews. Rightly so.</p>
<p>Embarrassing story number three is from my very first day on air at what was then called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_FM">Star FM Port Macquarie</a>, formerly Rox, now Hit. I had a fill-in co-host for the week til my actual co-host was home from mental health break after the last co-host almost drove her mad.</p>
<p>It was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Men%27s_Day">International Men’s Day 2010</a>, so my pitch was that we try and get as many international men on the breakfast show as possible.</p>
<p>I start tweeting and mentioning people furiously figuring if I asked lots of people, a handful would reply. One of them was @russellcrowe.</p>
<p>I don’t know why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Crowe">Russell Crowe</a> called. My guess is that he thought I was a kid pranking him and he’d freak me out by actually calling.</p>
<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/joshuawithers/russell-crowe-unedited">Either way, here’s the awkward and uncomfortable recording on Soundcloud.</a></p>
<p>I die inside listening to that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More evidence suggests that nature does something essential for our mental health. Specifically, we have learned that nature tends to result in reduced circulating levels of the stress hormones adrenaline and cortisol, lowered blood pressure, blunted “perceived stress” after stressful life events, and lower short-term levels of anxiety and depression. We also appear to ruminate less after we’ve spent time in nature, a phenomenon distinct enough to appear as differences in neural activity during brain scans. One recent study selected 541 vacant lots across the city of Philadelphia and randomly allocated each to either receive no intervention; receive regular trash removal and mowing; or be turned into open pocket parks, with trees and a pleasant, short wooden-perimeter fence. Survey teams blind to the intervention were sent out to question residents at random before and after the great experiment, eventually interviewing nearly 450 people about their mental health. When the study was complete, its architects found that residents of neighborhoods where lots had been greened were much healthier psychologically than those whose lots had merely been cleaned. Around greened lots, neighborhood-level rates of feeling “depressed” dropped by 42%, feeling “worthless” by 51% and having generally “poor mental health” by 63 percent.</p>

<p>But for the past year all I have thought about is what will happen to my blog when I die.</p>

			 <p>A mate mentioned pirating software and it took me right back to 20 years ago where we had a keygen or a hack or serial number for ecverything.</p>
<p>They really were the good ol days, access to the world&rsquo;s software, entertainment, and media, the only cost was time, so much time waiting for the painfully slow internet to bring you the goods.</p>
<p>It’s a hard position to advocate for - piracy - but letting kids have free access to software created a generation of modern creatives and tech professionals. Back then, to learn Photoshop or CAD or programming we’d pirate it, now you’ve got to pony up dollars every month. How do kids today learn this stuff without paying thousands of dollars they don’t havre for it?</p>

			 <p>Here is the punchline: the Metaverse already exists, it just happens to be called the Internet. Consider the seven qualities Matthew Ball used to define the Metaverse; the Internet satisfies all of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Internet is persistent</li>
<li>The Internet is synchronous and live</li>
<li>The Internet has no cap to concurrent users, while also providing each user with an individual sense of “presence”</li>
<li>The Internet has a fully functioning economy</li>
<li>The Internet is an experience that spans both the digital and physical worlds, private and public networks/experiences, and open and closed platforms</li>
<li>The Internet offers unprecedented (although not perfect) interoperability of data, digital items/assets, content, etc.</li>
<li>The Internet is populated by “content” and “experiences” created and operated by an incredibly wide range of contributors</li>

			 <p>One of my earliest memories - and there&rsquo;s only a few from this traumatic time in my life - is watching my new step-mother, Selena, pile up all of our childhood photos, memories of my mother, and the family before Selena arrived, and burn them in the backyard.
It was quite ceremonial and I imagine it must have felt quite nice for her. But I&rsquo;ve always wondered what the significance was.</p>
<p>Burning the photos didn&rsquo;t make my mother burn, despite her absence at the time, but it wasn&rsquo;t until later in life that I recognised what she was burning: my story.</p>
<p>My first camera was a Nokia 7600 with an almighty 0.3 megapixel sensor and the magic of capturing photos overcame me.</p>
<p>Which leads me to today.</p>
<p>I make photos today, they&rsquo;re ok, but I&rsquo;m really interested in discovering how photos matter to people, how my photos can matter to people, and if they would.</p>
<p>My plan</p>
<p>The plan is to document these learnings, what I&rsquo;ve experienced and learned so far, dive into equipment, techniques, and talk about money, in an email/blog called &ldquo;Shudder Speed&rdquo; and you can subscribe, all free, <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/hellojoshwithers/">shudderspeed.co</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll share what I&rsquo;ve learned, ask questions of my friends that are practising photographers, and reach out to strangers to ask the same questions.</p>
<p>Sometime in the next decade or so maybe I&rsquo;ll figure out how to make photos that matter to people other than me, and I&rsquo;d love to drag you along for the ride.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been lucky enough to create weddings all over the globe and I&rsquo;ve been trying to make photos that matter that entire time. Generally speaking I&rsquo;ve been mostly unsuccessful at reaching this goal, but the few times one of my photos has mattered to someone will be documented in upcoming emails.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still creating weddings and elopements, and intend to continue until people stop asking me to.</p>

			 <p>That distinctive, earthy odour that is associated with rainfall is called petrichor. When raindrops land on a porous surface, air from the pores forms small bubbles, which float to the surface and release aerosols. Such aerosols carry a scent as well as bacteria and viruses from the soil. The scent is called petrichor.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>On the first day of the Sydney lockdown that&rsquo;s currently ending, I had a wedding booked in the Blue Mountains. I was driving down (flights had been cancelled twice) at the time the lockdown was announced and I told the couple I couldn&rsquo;t attend their wedding because:</p>
<ol>
<li>The couple lived in one of the four local government area’s that had been ordered to stay at home, the NSW Premier said at the time “if you live or work in those four local government areas you should not leave your home unless you have to.”</li>
<li>Sydney was entering a pretty severe lockdown and weddings were banned, there was literally four reasons given to leave the house. Weddings were allowed &ldquo;for compassionate reasons” on the day they were married and I didn&rsquo;t think that an elopement with no guests for a local couple who hadn&rsquo;t communicated any compassionate reasons was more important than public safety.</li>
<li>I would need to quarantine on arrival back to Queensland for two weeks afterward which is super fun for work and leave me making a financial loss on the wedding.</li>
</ol>
<p>I offered to freely postpone to a time when they were allowed to marry, and if I couldn&rsquo;t be there, I&rsquo;d hire a celebrant in my place.</p>
<p>They rejected that offer and found a celebrant and photographer who would flout the stay at home orders.</p>
<p>Today a NSW Civil &amp; Administrative Tribunal member issued them a full refund because I told them I couldn&rsquo;t come, instead of just leaving them high and dry and not turning up, because then it would have then been a force majeure event.</p>
<p>So just in case you were curious, lockdowns mean nothing to consumer action, law is an ever flexible and changing ball of goo, the wedding industry really is not going well after two years of this, and apparently I now it&rsquo;s my job to report a couple to NSW Police for breaching stay at home orders.</p>
<p>Covid sucks. Covid has almost completely killed my passion for weddings.</p>

			 <p>How do you know things?</p>
<p>I think all day every day about the world I want to leave Luna and Goldie in.</p>
<p>I spend so much time wondering how to teach them how to know things. What they know will forever by growing and changing, but how they know things. How they learn, and how they research, and experiment, that’s so important to me.</p>
<p>So I’ve decided to create email accounts for them and to start writing to them. Because my words matter to them.</p>
<p>Your words matter.</p>
<p>Share them, with anyone, everyone, with me.</p>
<p>I don’t really care about fitting in with cool buzzwords and virtue signalling. But tell me how you lived in a tense moment today and how it was weird or awkward, but we learned more about each other.</p>
<p>Tell me about how you didn’t know something and you said you didn’t know.</p>
<p>Tell me about how you were scared and you said you were scared.</p>
<p>Life’s too short for platitudes and fitting in. Let’s be scared, daft, vulnerable, and authentic together. I don’t care what you know, but I’d love to know how you know it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The measure of a commercially successful newspaper is not simply how well it reports the big events, but what it does when there are no dying statesmen, bloodthirsty desperadoes, or heinous crimes to write about. Hearst succeeded in New York not only because he knew how to report the big stories, but because he was a master at constructing news from nothing.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From The Chief: The Life of William Randolph Hearst, via <a href="https://perell.com">David Perell’s email</a>.</p>
<p>David goes on to say,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Newspapers aren’t any shorter on a slow news day. People need to stay busy. Advertisements still need to be fulfilled. The revenue needs to keep rolling in.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To that end, the biggest source of bias in the media industry isn’t the perspective a newspaper takes on a story, but its decision to report on a story in the first place. Knowing that, Hearst was a master at taking inconsequential stories and turning them into must-reads. He knew that events only become news once journalists and editors commit to publicizing them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Are things any different today?”</p>

			 <p>Sunday was a doozy. Over the past few months we’ve shared photos on social media from trips when travel was allowed and legal, in a time when it wasn’t allowed. So the Queensland Police received an anonymous tip to Crimestoppers, and that was the start of the day. Luckily I keep great photo and travel records and we didn’t actually breach travel restrictions. So thanks, anonymous.</p>
<p>To end the day last night’s groom got aggressive and threatening because as his wedding celebrant, MC, DJ, I played songs not on his playlist, as he called it “my standard list”. My music selection had people dancing. I guess he wanted his wedding to be a show of his music taste instead of the red flag he kept on waving: “it’s her day.”</p>

<p>“The page loads, and a little video ad box rises from the bottom left of the screen and begins buffering. Then a big box pops up over the small one with an offer to subscribe to the paper at a special promotional rate. As you contemplate it, the video begins to play in a muted spasm. This throws a scrim of gray over the rest of the page, making it impossible to read.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Before you can deal with any of this, you’ll need to close this subscription box. You can achieve this by clicking either a tiny “x” or a passive-aggressive statement like “No, I don’t want great articles.” But while you’ve been triaging a second small video player has floated up into the middle left of the screen. A sedan silently snakes along a road hewn into a mountain and forces itself into your consciousness. It switches to a video of the Mets’ new manager, which you do not really want. Also, you now have to close a new rectangular ad at the bottom of the screen, advertising the same subscription offer as the first pop-up box.”</p>

			 <p>Author Anne Lamott on imperfection:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Almost everyone is screwed up, broken, clingy, scared, and yet designed for joy. Even (or especially) people who seem to have it more or less together are more like the rest of us than you would believe. I try not to compare my insides to their outsides, because this makes me much worse than I already am, and if I get to know them, they turn out to have plenty of irritability and shadow of their own. Besides, those few people who aren’t a mess are probably good for about twenty minutes of dinner conversation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This is good news, that almost everyone is petty, narcissistic, secretly insecure, and in it for themselves, because a few of the funny ones may actually long to be friends with you and me. They can be real with us, the greatest relief. As we develop love, appreciation, and forgiveness for others over time, we may accidentally develop those things toward ourselves, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>While you were making those measurements of different real-world cities, did you discover any surprising patterns or spatial relationships?</strong>
Yes, definitely. I think the biggest one was the parking lots. When I started measuring out our local grocery store, which I don&rsquo;t think of as being that big, I was blown away by how much more space was parking lot rather than actual store. That was kind of a problem, because we were originally just going to model real cities, but we quickly realized there were way too many parking lots in the real world and that our game was going to be really boring if it was proportional in terms of parking lots.</p>

			 <p>Instead of labelling antivaxxers or vaccine-hesitant people as stupid etc, could we consider how we as a society have contributed to the rapid distrust of elected officials and pharmaceutical companies?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m married to a vaccine hesitant person and she&rsquo;s not stupid. But she finds valid and real reason to distrust the choir of voices singing the &ldquo;just get vaccinated, ya know&rdquo; song.</p>
<p>Honestly, she brings more reading material, albeit embroiled in conjecture, than the &ldquo;hey idiots, blindly believe the govt and just get vaxxed&rdquo; crowd.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2021/09/02/ten-years-ago.html">Ten years ago today Sea FM Gold Coast fired it&#39;s drive and night radio shows</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2021/09/02/ten-years-ago.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-09-02 12:42:00 &#43;1000">Sep 2, 2021</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Ten years ago tonight, September 2nd 2010, the 90.9 Sea FM Gold Coast studios created a local afternoon and evening show for the last time.</p>
<p>This story means little to most Australian radio listeners, but there used to be so many more people employed in the creation of radio. In 2010/2011 that number dropped significantly as radio networks merged, like Macquarie Regional Radio with Austereo did and RG Capital with DMG Radio before it. In the last decade the number of people engaged in the creation of local radio would have reduced to be a fraction of what it was in 2003 when I started in the industry.</p>
<p>I feel like columns like this generally provide a slanted view of it being good or bad, but I truly don&rsquo;t know. It isn&rsquo;t like The Benchwarmers were creating radio that mattered, or that the Big Kahuna was making radio that changed people. We were just a bunch of humans being paid to have fun for your enjoyment. We loved it, you loved it, advertisers loved it, we got paid.</p>
<p>Through Covid people who “have fun for your enjoyment” have suffered through the absence of live shows and events, and I wonder if we will ever know the true loss we’d be left with if we keep on minimising the number of people who have fun for our enjoyment.</p>
<p>I hope we can always find a business model for fun. Traditionally fun was paid for by advertisers, but in 2021 we as a society feel less comfortable with that business model, but the only other one is one where we the consumer pay up.</p>

			 <p>Today I said goodbye to my prized and precious, the oldest and longest owned computer I’ve ever had the privilege of caring for, my Apple iMac G4.</p>
<p>It might not be the ideal computer for modern work, but I haven’t seen, nor owned, a more beautiful computer yet. I’ve used faster, more helpful, more able computers. But none that have been so simply beautiful, to the eye, and to the touch.</p>
<p>20 years on, never serviced or repaired, it still boots, the PowerPC CPU still computes, the hard drive still works, in-fasct all of the components still work. The optical drive, ethernet ports, all the USB ports still work, along with the USB tech accepting brand new USB keyboards, mice, and touchpads.</p>
<p>Who would of imagined that an almost 20 year old computer would mostly work today?</p>
<p>The only real negative impact 2021 had on this computer was browsing the modern web, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/03/31/tenfourfox_dev_quits/">the main problem being SSL</a>.</p>
<p>If I was a wiser and richer man, I’d keep her in pristine condition and in a box, ready to take out and show my grandkids in 30 years, alas, I have not the time or the space, so instead I’ll leave them this 2021 blog post about a 2002 computer released in the aftermath of the Y2K bug, the Dot-Com Boom, and the fall of the Twin Towers.</p>
<p>A computer that was not matched in style for at least 20 years.</p>

<p>“Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile. You’ve just gotta fight your way through.”</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been extraordinarily blessed to have so many phone calls, messages, offers of help regarding my recent post, <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2021/08/07/a-wedding-celebrants.html">I&rsquo;m not ok</a>.</p>
<p>I wanted to offer a few follow-up remarks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Donations: Some of the world&rsquo;s most generous people have made offers of finance to us. I won&rsquo;t say no, that&rsquo;s rude, but I also am not asking. We&rsquo;re provided for today, and luckily we have things to sell.</li>
<li>Getting a new job: I have very mixed feelings about this. One one hand, I&rsquo;m a really good celebrant, and people like what I create, and I&rsquo;ve been blessed to create weddings around the globe, literally from Iceland to New Zealand and everywhere in between, and I really enjoy(ed) celebrancy before March 2020. On the other hand I have a responsibility to provide for myself and my family, and if one job isn&rsquo;t available, get a new job. I&rsquo;m honestly open to job offers for those who know my background and skills, the problem is that I have a large backlog of weddings and elopements that have to get done some day, and that would seemingly be a large burden to a new employer, to have me having random days off.</li>
<li>My mental health: I think I&rsquo;m ok mostly in that regard. I know that the last 17 months have been traumatic and left me scarred, but I&rsquo;m not sitting here thinking bad thoughts. That said, I could do with seeing someone, I just don&rsquo;t want to see the kind of psychologists I&rsquo;ve seen in the past who seem quite clinical and have great breathing techniques - they&rsquo;re fine - but I know how to breath now. I don&rsquo;t know who I need to see, or if I can afford that, but if you know, let me know.</li>
<li>Gratitude: A former colleague from when I was on breakfast radio, was kind enough and generous enough to lend me his ear over the phone recently, but he had a hidden and kind motive, to introduce me to <a href="https://theresilienceproject.com.au">The Resilience Project</a>, so I&rsquo;m working my way through that idea and working on a gratitude journal, and trying to get into that headspace. It&rsquo;s not natural to me, but I&rsquo;m getting there. Thanks Mat, you&rsquo;ve always been so good to me.</li>
<li>Further gratitude: As I&rsquo;ve mentioned, so many have been kind enough to share, comment, tweet, message, DM, email me. You guys are the real MVP. I wanted to share for the same reason Britt and I shared we were pregnant with Goldie before the &ldquo;time&rdquo; you&rsquo;re supposed to tell everyone. When we lost our first baby we told everyone a few days before we found out that the pregnancy wasn&rsquo;t continuing. That sucked, but it was the best situation, because our friends and family were on the journey with us. Thank you for being on the journey with us. I don&rsquo;t share for pity or to ask for donations. I share because we&rsquo;re all in this together, warts and all.</li>
</ol>
<p>TL;DR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m ok, but not ok, and I&rsquo;d like new work, but it&rsquo;s complicated, and I have skills. I should talk to someone, but I talked to Mat, and I&rsquo;m grateful. Thank you.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I see so many of my friends, and randoms I follow on the Internet, talking about lockdown and Covid has affected them.</p>
<p>Stories of woe like having to takeaway instead of dine-in, holidaying in Australia instead of overseas, and some people have even been forced to share their home and their office with partners and children. Horrible stuff. And maybe for some of the unlucky ones you’ve had hours cut and some have lost jobs. It’s a tough time for all.</p>
<p>The average Australian online complains about things I could dream of. How I would love to just go to work today.</p>
<p>Over here in wedding-world, things are not looking good. The whole industry, all of us, are barely alive.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of the wedding industry, payment is made before the wedding, often more than a month before, sometimes many months. Which was lovely for a period there, because although we couldn’t work, at least we had money. JobKeeper brought some relief early on as well, though with mixed results, also JobKeeper wasn’t built for an industry that is in perpetual postponement. See how it ended in March?</p>
<p>That’s the issue with weddings compared to the entertainment and hospitality industry. Weddings are planned well in advance with very particular attendees coming from across the globe, and they are extremely intimate and personal events deeply shrouded in emotion and feeling.</p>
<p>You might be upset to not see a comedy or music show, but when your wedding is postponed for the second and third time you start to wonder whether the coronavirus is actually reading your wedding invitations.</p>
<p>Here in August 2021 I’m seeing 90% of the next three months of work being postponed to next year, and I’m getting calls from couples well into next year asking if they can postpone later. Most of these couples are on their third, fourth, and for at least one, their sixth wedding plan.</p>
<p>Most paid me a year or more ago. Some are just calling quits on the whole thing, demanding a refund - that I can’t afford to give - so they’re taking me to court. I’ve had over $90,000 of cancelled work across our two brands tht my wife and I manage.</p>
<p>The extra vector of pain for us is that for the last decade we’ve been stupid enough to build an international and interstate brand. Most of my work, almost all of my work in 2019 and 2020, was a flight away. So in rescheduling we need the couple, myself, their guests, and the state government’s to all co-ordinate. Hell.</p>
<p>Plus no-one in their right mind is booking a wedding today. I wouldn’t. With rolling lockdowns being announced with six hours notice on a Saturday (thanks Queensland, you lovely asses), there’s no way in hell I’d be planning to host a wedding today.</p>
<p>And the beautiful thing is that I can’t even take a new job today because the couples who have already contracted me for their wedding or elopement expect me to turn up next week - unless they postpone because then they expect me to turn up next year.</p>
<p>So what do we do?</p>
<p>I’m studying a Certificate IV in Real Estate so I can take a new job if there is one, we’re selling our investments, and depleting our savings. We apply for the $750 Covid disaster payment and wait for any other assistance my 24 years of taxation might be able to provide.</p>
<p>I guess the only main takeaway you should have is that if you’re getting married in the next few years, expect to be surprised at the cost - you’ll be paying for the covid-injuries the industry sustained.</p>
<p>And when events are back on, go support the legends in the arts and entertainment industries, they’re hurting like the wedding industry is.</p>

			 <p>Pro-vax, anti-vax, pro-lockdown, anti-lockdown, everyone&rsquo;s trying to join a team, but so few people are understanding the hurt that others are feeling. Whilst you might be annoyed by wearing a masking, or other people not-wearing a mask, all whilst your income, stability, and quality of life hasn&rsquo;t changed in the last year, many have lost more than they&rsquo;d care to mention, or even have the words to describe.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need to be right. No-one cares if you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>We need to care, we need empathy, we need consideration and understanding.</p>
<p>Because in 300 years when we&rsquo;re all dust, no-one&rsquo;s going to be telling stories about how right you were. But they&rsquo;ll speak about our legacy of empathy and care.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I really enjoy making photos.</p>
<p>This photo is one of my favourites, it&rsquo;s of an unknown hiker taking a breather at Taft Point in Yosemite National Park.</p>
<p>Something I&rsquo;m struggled with for the longest time is that I identify as a celebrant, that&rsquo;s what I do, but I really enjoy making photos of, and for, people.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve been married by me, you&rsquo;ve probably received a text message after your wedding with a sneaky photo, and an apology to your photographer for cutting their grass.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my modus operandi, I&rsquo;m already at an epic location for a sweet wedding, and there&rsquo;s another photographer there directing, creating, expressing, and I steal a shot in the background. Most are pretty cool with it, and some, like my mate James Day, have been encouraging me in it for a while now. But it&rsquo;s a bit cheap of me to steal other people&rsquo;s shots, the real thing to do, is to make my own.</p>
<p>So today when I met with a couple about making photos at their wedding I felt so excited at the prospect of a new avenue of creativity for me, and the possibility of creating meaningful and enjoyable work for you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a photography website, or portfolio, or packages, or prices. I&rsquo;ve been a wedding celebrant for over 12 years now, and I love doing that, but somewhere along the way I&rsquo;ll figure out how me making photos can be a thing I market, but for now, feel free to check out the really quick portfolio I made with Adobe today so I had something to show the couple today, at <a href="https://www.joshwithers.photos">www.joshwithers.photos</a> and if you&rsquo;re willing to take a bet on a celebrant making photos at your wedding, slide on in to those DMs</p>

			 <p>Since the moment Steve Jobs introduced us to the iPhone, Australian users have had bad weather data.</p>
<p>The Australian Bureau of Meteorology is the only true source of weather data in Australia, but Apple sources it’s data from Weather.com, even though it owns Dark Sky now. That said, Dark Sky’s data doesn’t seem accurate in Australia either.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t matter how you skin it, Apple Weather has had bad data <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2021/05/01/four-different-weather.html">for a long time</a>, and it continues in iOS 15.</p>

<p>”Convincing someone to change their mind is really the process of convincing someone to change their tribe. If they abandon their beliefs, they run the risk of losing social ties. You can’t expect someone to change their mind if you take away their community too. You have to give them somewhere to go. Nobody wants their worldview torn apart if loneliness is the outcome.&quot;</p>

Three email accounts, one with 170,000 odd emails, another with 40,000 odd, and another with about 1000 emails. Mail.app is barely useable, so slow and it takes minutes to refresh when I change mailbox. Is this just Mail.app now or am I doing it wrong? Googling isn&rsquo;t helping as there are so many bland articles on speeding up Mail.app. I&rsquo;ve rebuilt the mailboxes, and I&rsquo;ve even done the deleting index thing. Any ideas?</p>

			 <p>Seeing John Gruber’s <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/30/hello-weather">recommendation</a> of a new weather app, Hello Weather (it’s a beautiful app, just feels a little weird that two Basecamp devs are involved, that brand name is tainted after the last week).</p>
<p>I noticed its primary weather data provider is Dark Sky, the now Apple-owned American-focused weather data source.</p>
<p>So I checked my four installed weather apps to see how they reported the current weather in my location right now (Lilydale, Victoria, Australia) and not one current temp lined up.</p>
<p>The first screenshot is Hello Weather sourcing from Dark Sky. The second is Carrot Weather sourcing from the Australian source, WillyWeather, which also gets data from BoM. The third screenshot is the built-in Apple Weather app sourced from the American Weather.com, and the fourth is a screenshot from the Australian government’s own official Bureau of Meteorology official app.</p>
<p>How is weather data so hard?</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A link between childhood “screen time” and attention problems has failed to replicate in this study.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We evaluated 848 models, including logistic regression as per the original paper, plus linear regression and two forms of propensity score analysis. Only 166 models (19.6%) yielded a statistically significant relationship between early TV exposure and later attention problems, with most of these employing problematic analytic choices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The funny thing is that I know that Luna&rsquo;s mood changes when she has spent time in front of the TV, she&rsquo;s less co-operative and less joyful, despite really enjoying TV, and strongly desiring it at various times.</p>
<p>So maybe TV as a child doesn&rsquo;t affect their attention, but it does affect their sensibilities, in my humble opinion as a father of two.</p>

			 <p>Very very few stories are worth telling in their infancy. Most require research, understanding, context, empathy, and nuance.</p>
<p>For example, what if a story about girls twerking on a navy ship in front of the Governor General was held onto for a a day and some research was done?</p>
<p>But we as a society have decided not to invest in that research. We complain if a news website needs us to pay a subscription, and we scream about defunding the ABC if they don&rsquo;t say what we want.</p>
<p>So we end up with an angry story that&rsquo;s not entirely true, based on the premise that girls shouldn&rsquo;t dance on boats.</p>
<p>If you think about it, aren&rsquo;t we all twerking seamen on the navy ship of our lives? Thanks for getting to the end of this, I really just wanted you to consider yourself as a twerking sailor.</p>

			 <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not all men, but it&rsquo;s only men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those are some tough words to read, thank you for sharing Damien Johnson.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not all men, but it is all people who look like me, who identify like I do, it is people who I could be mistaken for, or more importantly, people who I don&rsquo;t fear but are fearful to other people.</p>
<p>I was thinking about the time that Dale and Barney and I were bashed up by a bunch of guys only meters from the cafe strip in Broadbeach, that was the first and last time I&rsquo;ve ever been scared for my life, and I&rsquo;m lead to believe that so many women feel that level of fear a lot more than I ever have.</p>
<p>I believe that a real inhibitor in the conversation about all this</p>
<p>To my brothers who feel threatened by the current movement, my encouragement would be that if you&rsquo;ve done no wrong, if you&rsquo;re not abusing your position by suggesting or insinuating sexual motives towards women who you have no right to do so to, then we have nothing to fear.</p>
<p>Stand by our girls and let them know you&rsquo;re sick of it to, because I sure am. We can&rsquo;t go back from this, we can&rsquo;t go around it, or over it, we need to go through it.</p>
<p>Girls, I&rsquo;m with you, it is ridiculous that you should feel fear to be in public alone, for it to be our default position that you are not safe in the presence of unknown men, and even worse than that, for you not to be safe in the presence of known men.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not all men, but it&rsquo;s only men.</p>

			 <p>No-one&rsquo;s betting on a 2% chance of winning anything. If there&rsquo;s a 2% chance of anything happening, that basically means the thing isn&rsquo;t happening. Our doctor said there would be a 2% chance of us ever falling pregnant, and an even lower chance of us having two children.</p>
<p>But by God&rsquo;s grace we&rsquo;ve won that lottery twice now, so I&rsquo;d love to introduce you to our little girl born yesterday, 4kg and healthy as you could ever hope for, please say hello to Goldie Grace Withers.</p>

			 <p>I bet you have an opinion on politicians and who is a terrible one.</p>
<p>Do you think the incentives that used to exist to become a pollie/leader have evaporated while the work/accountability has (rightly) increased significantly, so less of the best people in our community want to stand up to lead today?</p>
<p>I’ve honestly considered serving in government, and aside from rabid imposter syndrome, and not knowing if I’m the kind of person that I think should be a leader in the community - like a MP - the incentive for me to stand up is ever reducing.</p>
<p>I can think of it now, journos or keyboard warriors scouring over my years of internet history. Past clients who didn’t like me weighing in on podcasts, and imagine if they started talking to my family about politics or even me. Like my first step-mother probably still thinks I’m a gay priest like I overheard her telling someone a few years ago. All whilst earning a less than corporate wage but not having the liberties to act like a corporation but instead, acting in the best interest of the electorate - not just those who elected you.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;d like a new Mavic model please.</p>
<p>In late 2016, five years ago, you set my heart on fire. I&rsquo;d been watching the Phantoms ghosting through the sky making aerial photography for three years. Your Inspire line had inspired me for over two. But the Mavic, the sweet little foldable package with a great camera, won me over, be still my beating heart.</p>
<p>That first relationship with the Mavic Pro was like the first time I drank whisky neat. I knew everything before then was wrong, and only this was right. I saw the Platinum and the Air taxi onto the UAV runways of our hearts and knew something bigger was coming.</p>
<p>And in late 2018 that Mavic 2 boarding call sounded. I fell in love all over again. With the choice between a Zoom model or a Pro model with that fat &lsquo;Blad camera, I knew the Mavic 2 Pro was for me, and boy did we see the world. That Mavic 2 Pro and I, we travelled far and wide. Through America, New Zealand, Bali, Iceland, and all over my home that they call Downunder, we made photos and videos and had so much fun.</p>
<p>In Iceland in late 2019 my little Two Pro got a little bit confused - I think we were too close to the Arctic polar cap - and despite my best piloting, the compass wanted more, and she flew into the distance, and I&rsquo;m guessing the side of a mountain about 25 minutes flight time away. Luckily for me, the DJI Go app data saved my bacon and a warranty-replaced Mavic 2 was in the mail.</p>
<p>In late 2020 the drone and my relationship had blossomed to the point where I felt like we could expand our boundaries and try new positions. On this one sunset afternoon one of us got a little too close to a wave, and then amidst the confusion, we got a little too close to a rock pool, and the rocks, and the pool, and things didn&rsquo;t end well.</p>
<p>Alas, now I am drone-less.</p>
<p>I even received spousal approval for a new purchase as a birthday present last year.</p>
<p>But I look at the DJI product lineup and can&rsquo;t help but feel like it&rsquo;s missing a Mavic 3. In the intervening years new Airs and Minis have been released, so your passion for small has not waned. Yet the Mavic line of spectacular cameras, rocking some sweet sweet Hasselblad glass on a small and foldable aircraft, has gone wanting.</p>
<p>Please put a new drone into my hands, DJI.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t make me buy whatever Sony is selling.</p>

<ul>
<li>Answer a complaint from the Office Of Fair Trading about a couple who changed their 2020 wedding date to a day I wasn&rsquo;t available for, and then was available for but then they didn&rsquo;t want me, and who weren&rsquo;t eligible for a refund, but got a 50% refund any way and they&rsquo;ve taken us to the OFT for the remaining 50%.</li>
<li>Respond to a credit card chargeback for an elopement that was supposed to be in New Zealand last September but they moved it to April 2021 and just recently decided they wanted to get married now in Western Australia while the borders were closed.</li>
<li>File another couple&rsquo;s wedding cancellation.</li>
<li>Freak out about the calendar for the rest of the year because almost every new enquiry I&rsquo;m not available for because last year&rsquo;s weddings are now in this year&rsquo;s calendar unless of course they&rsquo;re taking us to court because COVID ruined their wedding and they expect refunds from small businesses when even Qantas only gives credit vouchers.</li>
<li>Apply to a court to actually hold a hearing regarding a refund complaint for a Brisbane couple who had booked us for a Western Australian elopement but because WA closed their borders we all couldn&rsquo;t get there so instead of planning something in the possible they took us to court and the court didn&rsquo;t hold a hearing it just ruled in their favour so I now need to ask them to set that ruling aside wtf?</li>
<li>Take more photos of Luna.</li>
<li>Get in-house legal counsel?</li>
<li>Procrastinate on social media.</li>
<li>Wonder if there&rsquo;ll be a SanityKeeper? I don&rsquo;t want your money, ScoMo, I just want to go to Hawaii whilst this bushfire burns.</li>

			 <p>This is a powerful read for people trying to mentally tie a bow on the 2010s. Ranjan wraps it up saying that the cheap money thanks to near zero interest rate policies we’ve had since the GFC, and social media algorithms, are what shaped the last ten years of our lives.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I&rsquo;m incredibly excited about the coming decade because I am genuinely hopeful the two core trends I outlined will be reversed.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Algorithmically-optimized lying has prominently entered the conversation to the point our ex-President was kicked off. There’s simply no way money can remain this cheap for a prolonged period of time. What that unwind looks like is an entirely separate post, but there will once again be discipline imposed on the allocation of capital. Financial and technological regulation is far more imaginable than just a few years ago. Change is coming.”</p>

			 <p>A friend kindly and jokingly mentioned that life for us looked to be all fun going by social media recently.</p>
<p>And life is pretty fine, but &hellip;</p>
<p>So I thought I&rsquo;d share what the first half of just today has been for me.</p>
<ul>
<li>2 couples cancelling.</li>
<li>3 couples moving to new dates, two of those in different cities both moved to dates next to each other so that&rsquo;s four weddings in a row that week in July.</li>
<li>1 couple who have had 2 New Zealand bookings with us already, and we&rsquo;ve been working with them since November 2019 on their elopement bookings, are now fighting for a refund because they just want to get married now despite WA closing their borders again.</li>
<li>2 flights cancelled, with new tickets issued after a call to Qantas, but with one of the flights we now need to fly in a day earlier - so I&rsquo;m not home for Britt&rsquo;s birthday - but the accomodation isn&rsquo;t available a day earlier so we need to get extra accomodation and of course, at our own cost because imagine if I asked the couple to pay for it because Qantas isn&rsquo;t flying out of Gold Coast that day.</li>
<li>3 wedding enquiries replied to.</li>
<li>4 mentoring and support replies to Celebrant Institute members needing business support.</li>
<li>Plus our home which we haven&rsquo;t been in since March last year because we rented it out so we could travel to weddings and elopements around the globe for a year, has a pool problem so I&rsquo;m on the phone with the pool company and the real estate trying to not spend thousands fixing a pool problem that wouldn&rsquo;t have happened if we were in our home.</li>
</ul>
<p>Which is all fine, seriously, this is just my job, and I&rsquo;m doing it.</p>
<p>But this is simply four hours of a Friday morning in my life sitting in a Hobart Airbnb about to drive two hours to an elopement that was supposed to happen in Tuscany last year for the loveliest couple who I legally married last March when we were sure we&rsquo;d be in Italy in July for them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m honestly just really over it all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been 319 days since we were in our home and our business was 100% fun and I feel like we&rsquo;re being forced to apologise for running a successful international wedding business.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>19 years and four months ago today, when I was just 19, I woke up on the Gold Coast and discovered the United States of America.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Before the 12th of September, 2001, I knew of a foreign nation north of Mexico, south of Canada, where a few of my favourite TV shows, movies, and bands were from. I’d heard of ‘Bush’ or The White House&rsquo;, and between friends we’d joke about “not having sexual relations with that woman.”</p>
<p>Seinfeld was tied with South Park as my favourite TV show, and I thought I did a pretty good US accent for a gag.</p>
<p>But as Australia awoke on the 12th of September, 2001, we learned of the attacks on the USA.</p>
<p>I was glued to the TV news for days. I had a computer at home without an internet connection and couldn’t afford a phone line plus dialup Internet, but found out that Telstra offered prepaid telephone landlines and prepaid dialup internet, so within days had my own personal internet connection I could spend endless hours on (until my credit expired) discovering this &lsquo;America&rsquo; that was under attack.</p>
<p>I subscribed to Time Magazine and started reading stories of the American people coming together, being together, joining together, in the days and weeks after the attack. I was hooked.</p>
<p>I wanted to know everything there was to know about these people, and this country, that was so united despite the terror that rained down on them.</p>
<p>Over the years I&rsquo;ve been blessed to visit the &lsquo;home of the brave&rsquo; many times. I&rsquo;ve spoken at conferences there, and even married many couples in Hawaii, New York, Oregon, and California. I was even supposed to be there this week for a wedding in Orlando - but thanks to covid I&rsquo;m here, home, in Australia.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In 2011 when Donald Trump questioned if Barack Obama was &ldquo;made in America?&rdquo; it was simply comedy fodder for an Australian on breakfast radio. We all laughed.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But in the nine years since that tweet, through to today where Trump literally encouraged mobs of people to storm the US Capitol, that America I idolised has changed so greatly.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>America was a place I dreamed of &lsquo;making it&rsquo; and a country I always wanted to explore. I dreamt of living there and building a life a-fresh in the land of the free.</p>
<p>Today however, it&rsquo;s a whimper of the country I researched so earnestly in 2001.</p>
<p>Today it&rsquo;s divided, angry, and ignorant of the plight of the persons of America, so heavily focused on the synecdoche America, so ignorant of the American.</p>
<p>Oh, say can we see, that America I fell in love with 19 years ago?</p>

			 <p>I’ve found the most quotable book I’ve read in a while.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Imagine for a moment that a new drug comes on the market. It’s super-addictive, and in no time everyone’s hooked. Scientists investigate and soon conclude that the drug causes, I quote, ‘a misperception of risk, anxiety, lower mood levels, learned helplessness, contempt and hostility towards others, and desensitization’. Would we use this drug? Would our kids be allowed to try it? Would government legalise it? To all of the above: yes. Because what I’m talking about is already one of the biggest addictions of our times. A drug we use daily, that’s heavily subsidised and is distributed to our children on a massive scale. That drug is the news.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ruther Bergman’s book Humankind was recommended to me by my Aunt over Christmas as we talked about the light subject of saving the planet and bringing peace to planet earth.</p>
<p>Tracey recommended the book and in the first chapter Rutger is straight in for the attack on the news.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I was raised to believe that the news is good for your development. That as an engaged citizen it’s your duty to read the paper and watch the evening news. That the more we follow the news, the better informed we are and the healthier our democracy. This is still the story many parents tell their kids, but scientists are reaching very different conclusions. The news, according to dozens of studies, is a mental health hazard. First to open up this field of research, back in the 1990s, was George Gerbner (1919–2005). He also coined a term to describe the phenomenon he found: mean world syndrome, whose clinical symptoms are cynicism, misanthropy and pessimism. People who follow the news are more likely to agree with statements such as ‘Most people care only about themselves.’ They more often believe that we as individuals are helpless to better the world. They are more likely to be stressed and depressed. A few years ago, people in thirty different countries were asked a simple question: ‘Overall, do you think the world is getting better, staying the same, or getting worse?’ In every country, from Russia to Canada, from Mexico to Hungary, the vast majority of people answered that things are getting worse. The reality is exactly the opposite. Over the last several decades, extreme poverty, victims of war, child mortality, crime, famine, child labour, deaths in natural disasters and the number of plane crashes have all plummeted. We’re living in the richest, safest, healthiest era ever. So why don’t we realise this? It’s simple. Because the news is about the exceptional, and the more exceptional an event is – be it a terrorist attack, violent uprising, or natural disaster – the bigger its newsworthiness. You’ll never see a headline reading NUMBER OF PEOPLE LIVING IN EXTREME POVERTY DOWN BY 137,000 SINCE YESTERDAY, even though it could accurately have been reported every day over the last twenty-five years. Nor will you ever see a broadcast go live to a reporter on the ground who says, ‘I’m standing here in the middle of nowhere, where today there’s still no sign of war.’&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With a careful note on journalism versus the news:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, by ‘the news’ I don’t mean all journalism. Many forms of journalism help us better understand the world. But the news – by which I mean reporting on recent, incidental and sensational events – is most common.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then he slides right into Facebook and Silicon Valley’s current obsession with buying and retailing our attention.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This modern media frenzy is nothing less than an assault on the mundane. Because, let’s be honest, the lives of most people are pretty predictable. Nice, but boring. So while we’d prefer having nice neighbours with boring lives (and thankfully most neighbours fit the bill), ‘boring’ won’t make you sit up and take notice. ‘Nice’ doesn’t sell ads. And so Silicon Valley keeps dishing us up ever more sensational clickbait, knowing full well, as a Swiss novelist once quipped, that ‘News is to the mind what sugar is to the body.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe that ‘Humankind: A Hopeful History’ by Rutger Bregman is required reading for anyone who’s upset, angry, our generally uncomfortable about the state of our people entering 2021.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Phone addiction is one of the biggest non-drug addiction in human history. Studies show that excessive phone use is linked to procrastination, suicide (example), spoilt sleep, food and water neglect, headaches, lower productivity, unstable relationships, poor physical health (eye strain, body-aches, posture, hand strain), and poor mental health (depression, anxiety, stress). Some of these problems can be both causes and effects of phone addiction (procrastination, anxiety, unstable relationships, etc.).&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;2021 will be the year that publishers start to form strategies to deal with the Substack Problem. By that, I mean they’ll need to find ways to discourage their star writers from leaving to launch their own Substack newsletters. In the most likely scenario, they’ll make deals with writers to launch the newsletter under the banner of the media company. They might structure the deal so the writer gets to keep their current salary and then some percentage of the subscriber income they generate – similar to the advances and royalties that book publishers dole out. This will be enticing to the writers because they get to maintain job security while also benefiting directly from their success. They can also grow their audience much more quickly with the help of the media company. It’s a win win for both parties.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>Life on the internet, and in podcasting, is a game of middlemen (middlepeople?). The middlepeople actually really benefit from being in the middle, more than we imagine, and it&rsquo;s an easy position to hold, one that most of the middlepeople hold in secret. Spotify is muscling it&rsquo;s way into becoming the middle person between you, your favourite podcast, and <a href="https://twitter.com/PrivacyMatters/status/1344572245230776320">the 246 companies that receive that data</a>. Meanwhile big-spending <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/wondery-to-join-amazon-music">Amazon</a> is muscling it&rsquo;s way into our listening habits, and even my podcast app of choice, Overcast, is a middleperson by design in that the Overcast servers know what podcasts I listen to, and those servers are continually polling the different podcast servers.</p>
<p>Spotify and Amazon I take issue with because they want to put a toll booth, even if it&rsquo;s a free toll booth, on an already open road. Overcast is operating a booth on the road, but it&rsquo;s not taking a toll. Whilst all of that is going on, the original champions of the podcast space, Apple Podcasts is - more than possiblly unknowingly - <a href="https://medium.com/curious/apple-podcasts-poor-for-privacy-db7a826a6123">oversharing to the nth degree</a> about who is driving on the free road, and I feel like that sharing needs to be reduced.</p>

			 <h1 id="there-needs-to-be-a-better-way-to-internet">There needs to be a better way to Internet</h1>
<p>Maybe it’s because 2020 gave me many opportunities to think through the implications of which technology companies I’m quite beholden too, or maybe it’s because 2020 brought to light so many of the unhealthy business practices so many technology companies are embroiled in, but I’ve been trying to make big changes in my lifestyle in response to either, or both - because I believe that tech company algorithms are destroying marriages, friendships, families, and communities. I believe our <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2020/11/22/privacy-and-free.html">privacy</a> is important.</p>
<h2 id="social-media">Social Media</h2>
<p>I find so much connection and joy in the social elements of the web today, be it Facebook or Instagram, Twitter or YouTube, but I’m increasingly aware that anything more than a passing view into any of these portals is unhealthy for my soul, and an increasingly unhealthy place to “spend my data.”</p>
<p>I feel less and less comfortable with having my friendships, interests, politics, faith, and philosophy influenced by algorithms.</p>
<p>There’s a real tension here because I enjoy publishing and broadcasting stories - my own, my family’s, my friend’s, and the stories in my greater circle of life - plus I love listening to and reading your stories.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just an inherently unhealthy aspect to a non-human deciding what you should hear about from your community.</p>
<h2 id="podcasting">Podcasting</h2>
<p>I have a 25 year love story with the audio storytelling medium. It was 1996 when Paul McDermott, Mikey Robbins, and the Sandman were on Triple J for Breakfast and I feel in love with the idea of telling stories and entertainment purely through audio - no pictures, no words, no video.</p>
<p>As we skipped into a new millennium Dave Winer invented really simple syndication, RSS, and Adam Curry and Cameron Reilly started making podcasts, I witnessed the democratisation of audio away from broadcast radio despite forming and then walking away from a career in the artform.</p>
<p>Today as I witness Spotify and Amazon work hard at putting podcasts behind data-collecting, algorithm-driven, firewalls I honestly feel sad for the loss of the open industry of podcasting. I&rsquo;m not saying all podcasts should be free. I personally pay for a number of podcasts, I&rsquo;m just saying we should be able to access them without sacrificing personal freedoms, liberties, and without sharing excesses of personal data like what podcasts I listen to, which ones I listen all the way through, and the ideas algorithms can derive from that data.</p>
<p>Our entertainment and our information should be democratically available and curated by people, not by algorithms.</p>
<h2 id="news-information-and-articles">News, information, and articles</h2>
<p>If you search on Google today for &ldquo;The first podcast&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll see Google News articles for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle&rsquo;s first podcast episode.</p>
<p>Our news and information, our thought-pieces and studies, our stories and anecdotes deserve better than being submitted to an algorithmic in the hopes that the mathematics decide they&rsquo;re worth being read.</p>
<h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like the idea of the algorithms feeding me news, information, funny videos, and podcasts, to also be reading my messages and communications between people I love.</p>
<h2 id="photos">Photos</h2>
<p>I have so much love for the art of photography. I would love you to enjoy my photos, and even more so I&rsquo;d love to enjoy your viewport to the world. Maybe some of mine can hang on your wall as art, and vice-versa.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t want Facebook, Google, and Amazon to degrade that experience, and worse, abuse it for their own data-gathering needs about where we all were, and what we did.</p>
<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t use Google Android phones because I don&rsquo;t trust Google to run an operating system I could trust, and I use Apple computers because of the opposite, I enjoy knowing that my data is mostly processed locally - not in a data-overlord&rsquo;s cloud. It&rsquo;s an expensive choice, but until I know any better, I&rsquo;m using Apple computers and mobile phones.</p>
<h2 id="entertainment">Entertainment</h2>
<p>So many TVs today are selling our viewing data to advertising companies, and purely because Amazon and Google&rsquo;s names sre in the product title, the Chromecast and Fire sticks are products I don&rsquo;t trust.</p>
<h2 id="the-fix">The fix?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m leaning back into <a href="https://youtu.be/Qss5RnD7wK8">the open web</a>, reading blogs on people&rsquo;s own websites like mine where you&rsquo;re reading this to hear my friend&rsquo;s and family&rsquo;s stories, listening to open podcasts that are available to whoever would like to listen to them, articles and news organisations. I&rsquo;m communicating via phone call, iMessage, and email - <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2020/12/01/what-if-we.html">not via comment fields and discussion boards</a>, or if I am commenting and replying to posts I want to do it on a social network whose business model is clear and open, like Micro.Blog. Instead of waiting for entertainment, information, news, and articles to be recommended by an algorithm, I would like to see it in my RSS reader, or even better, see you link to it from your blog, and if I want you to read it, I can link to it from mine. I&rsquo;m taking my photos back from Google and Facebook and <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2020/12/30/a-new-family.html">sinking them deep into Apple Photos</a> because I feel like I can trust them to be stored safely and enjoyed beautifully there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not insisting that my choices are the only and best, but with what I know today, and with the resources I have, and what I&rsquo;d like to do and enjoy, I think these are pretty good choices.</p>
<h2 id="why-should-we-care">Why should we care?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m writing all this so I might encourage you to come with me. I love the idea of us not talking over Facebook Messenger, and finding out about your pregnancy via an Instagram Story. I relish the idea of you listening to a podcast and thinking I might enjoy it so you share it with me. I dream of a day where local news and information is broadcast and published without fear of it not performing well in the news feed or without generating enough advertising revenue.</p>
<p>I hope for a day where the internet and our relationships live harmoniously - not in fear of each other.</p>
<p>We might never get there, but we can try.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2020/12/30/a-new-family.html">A new family and travel photo workflow</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2020/12/30/a-new-family.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-12-30 15:08:00 &#43;1000">Dec 30, 2020</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>For my personal travel and family photos, I&rsquo;ve started a new photos workflow, and I thought other people who are beginning their family photo journey like I have in the past few years might be interested.</p>
<p>The premise of the workflow is that photos begin on my iPhone, Britt&rsquo;s iPhone, or my Sony A6400. They are processed, and then iCloud Photo Library is my one true family photo library.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve put loads (months) of work into clearing and culling that library down to about 21,000 photos now, and just recently finished geotagging every single last photo in the library using <a href="https://apps.apple.com/au/app/metapho/id914457352">Metapho</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Because I like the idea of capturing as much data as possible so I have wiggle room afterward, I shoot on my iPhone and Sony A6400 in RAW, and previously I&rsquo;ve used Lightroom to process photos then export to Photos. Recently however I&rsquo;ve moved processing to <a href="https://apps.apple.com/au/app/darkroom-photo-video-editor/id953286746">Darkroom</a>. I wasn&rsquo;t comfortable with paying for Lightroom CC storage, and then having to make decisions about keeping originals either on a hard drive, or to increase my subscription and size for Adobe&rsquo;s Cloud, so I&rsquo;m keeping them in Apple&rsquo;s iCloud - a product I already use and pay for.</p>
<p>The workflow simply looks like this:</p>
<p><strong>1. Import:</strong> I import the photos to my iPhone&rsquo;s camera roll. If I&rsquo;ve already taken photos on my phone, they&rsquo;re there. I ask Britt to Airdrop her photos to me. For photos from my camera I have the Apple Lightning to SD Card adapter, and import the raw DNGs straight into the camera roll.</p>
<p><strong>2. Cull:</strong> I delete photos I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll keep. They stay in the Apple Photos deleted items for 30 days, more than enough time for regret to realise itself, or for me to realise I never needed those photos anyway.</p>
<p><strong>3. Process:</strong> I open Darkroom and because I&rsquo;ve got access to my Photos library within Darkroom I can edit these new photos as I like. Darkroom has some great inbuilt presets and you can build your own as well.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>4. Modify Original:</strong> Once I&rsquo;m happy with the crop, straighten, clour grade, edit, and what-not within Darkroom this is the impotant step. In the top right hand corner is the share icon, and I choose &ldquo;Modify Original&rdquo; so that the adjustments are stored inside the image file. It&rsquo;s actually not stored inside, it&rsquo;s essentially a little zip file, with the .ARW raw DNG file from the camera, <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2020/a04d6c37a1.png">a .plist file with the adjustments made in Darkroom</a>, and then a rendered .JPG which is the image we all see, share, and enjoy. This means that there is a package in the iCloud Photo Library which containts those three files, totallying 40.4MB, instead of maybe 15.2MB. I don&rsquo;t know why this is important to me apart from my inner burning knowledge that once data is gone, you don&rsquo;t get it back.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>5. Location, location, location:</strong> Aside from the image itself, there are three pieces of metadata important to me. The first is the location, the geotag. I love how Apple Photos brings you memories inside the Photos app, and also on my homescreen using the new iOS 14 Photos widget, and those memories are often location related. So I use Metapho as discussed at the top to assign a geotag to every photo that doesn&rsquo;t have one. Metapho is smart in that it looks at images shot at the same time and date and tries to help by pivoting off that data. Photos taken on my iPhone generally already have a geotag, and photos taken on my Sony might be geotagged if the terrible Sony <a href="https://apps.apple.com/au/app/imaging-edge-mobile/id489191124">Imaging Edge</a> app was working that day. Images taken inside often have a slightly incorrect geotag as well, because GPS doesn&rsquo;t work in the house, so I&rsquo;ll correct those images.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>6. Who&rsquo;s in the photo?:</strong> This step needs some time, because your iPhone literally needs to be plugged in, and in sleep mode, generally overnight, sometimes for a few nights. The process is about allowing Apple <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT207103">Photos to read your photos and detect faces</a>. This all happens on device and at its own pace. I&rsquo;ll go back to photos and see what faces have been detected and I&rsquo;ll assign, or re-assign, the person name to that face so I could then search for photos of someone and find all of those photos in once search. This also adds into the memories feature. If Apple Photos hasn&rsquo;t detected a face after a few days and I&rsquo;m feeling pedantic, I&rsquo;ll open Photos on my MacBook and in the Get Info window you can add faces manually.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>7. Captions and Albums:</strong> I&rsquo;ll be honest, I have been lazy in this arena, but my goal is to caption photos accordingly, and if possible to also group them into manual albums based around events.</p>
<p><strong>8. What if they&rsquo;re professional photos?:</strong> We take as many opportunties as we can to have our photos taken professionally, and those photos are often delivered weeks later, often with not-correct date or time information, and with no geotag. I&rsquo;ll import all of these photos to my Apple Photos app and manually correct date, time, and geotag using Metapho.</p>
<p><strong>9. Backup:</strong> A final and important step is to make sure that Apple Photos on your device, and iCloud Photo Library in the cloud isn&rsquo;t the only place these photos exist. You always need a backup. Mine is Google Photos - which I regret - and also in Backblaze. Ideally I&rsquo;d have a physical backup but I&rsquo;m just not there yet. A really good backup is to also print the photos. You&rsquo;ll never regret hanging them on a wall or having the prints available to thumb through, like this photo of me as a toddler hanging at my aunty&rsquo;s house.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I hope this helped you formalise some sort of photo workflow for your own family and travel photos. It might not seem important today, but I can&rsquo;t kick the feeling that in 30 years time it will really matter.</p>

It’s business model isn’t sharing my personal data, it’s business model is to be a social networ, and it costs $5 a month, because if something is free you’re not the customer, you’re the product being sold.</p>

			 <p>Politics, infrastructure, and the national broadband network, known as the National Broadband Network is an absolute joke.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Minister for Communications, Urban Infrastructure, Cities and the Arts has made a formal declaration under section 48 of the National Broadband Network Companies Act 2011 that the National Broadband Network should be ‘treated as built and fully operational.’&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Under the Act the Minister must make such a declaration by 31 December 2020 – or formally extend the period within which such a declaration can be made.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>Thirty years ago today the first website, recreated at <a href="http://info.cern.ch">http://info.cern.ch</a>, was born.</p>
<p>Thirty years earlier than that, the internet - the global system of interconnected computer networks - was conceived, but it wasn&rsquo;t until the hypertext markup languag, HTML, lead the way to a HTML viewer - a web browser - and the first website became viewable on the 20th of December 1990.</p>
<p>Almost a century earlier we started realising the power of machine as a computer, and thirty years after we started connecting them in a network, we gave birth to a method of publishing and sharing knowledge, stories, information, on &ldquo;the web.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve never been more connected, and more divided. Who knew that when we smelt so much of each other that it all wouldn&rsquo;t be like roses.</p>

<p>When a local doctors surgery needs to run ads on its home page so Google is incentivised to rank that page higher - because Google makes money from displaying ads - then the whole thing is broken.</p>
<p>I understand the how and why of how and why were here. And the rankings on Google’s homepage are precious and meaningful to so many businesses, including mine, but what is the fix? It’s not like the Yellowpages were any better, if anything, the somewhat democratic algorithmic management of search rankings is better for the world.</p>

			 <p>Call me biased, but I&rsquo;m really proud of what Britt has created in <a href="https://elopementcollective.com">The Elopement Collective</a>. Not just because she&rsquo;s my wife or because I&rsquo;m her celebrant for her elopements.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m proud of what she creates because it has heart, soul, and purpose. Tune in below for a hot take on elopements.</p>
<p>2020&rsquo;s really been the year for eloping, and I&rsquo;ve watched on as everyone in the wedding industry has a go. It&rsquo;s been interesting seeing what people have made, and how couples have gotten married.</p>
<p>Here is the thing. An elopement is purely and only about two people getting married. It&rsquo;s not a small wedding, it&rsquo;s not a micro wedding, it&rsquo;s not a pop up wedding. Elopements aren&rsquo;t a photo shoot with a ceremony at the start, they aren&rsquo;t a styled shoot with some vows, they aren&rsquo;t about catering, styling, furniture, photos, film, florals, dresses, or venues. An elopement can have witnesses, but it&rsquo;s not about them, it&rsquo;s not about entertaining them, feeding them, occupying them, or hosting them.</p>
<p>An elopement is 100% and only about two people transitioning into marriage. If someone sees it, that&rsquo;s cream. If it happens somewhere lovey, that looks pretty, what a bonus. If we get a photo or two, and a film, we&rsquo;re in luck.</p>
<p>A wedding is about your guests, family and friends. An elopement is about the two of you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll selfishly and proudly say that because The Elopement Collective was born out of a strong belief in the power of marriage and ceremony, we make the best elopements.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m proud of you Britt, you&rsquo;re my rockstar.</p>

			 <p>An aspect of Apple&rsquo;s strategy - marketing and business growth/sustainability - that is often forgotten when they launch products is this: filtering.</p>
<p>Not all of Apple&rsquo;s products are for everyone. They&rsquo;re for some people. If the <a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods-max/">AirPods Max as a device, or at that price</a>, offend you - you&rsquo;re being filtered out. Your response is the correct and desired response Apple wants you to have. If these were headphones for everyone they&rsquo;d be $20 at a service station.</p>
<p>Honestly, it&rsquo;s a good reminder for anyone and everyone. You can&rsquo;t be the person, the service, the product for everyone. Even the world&rsquo;s most popular drink, or social network, or car, or phone, cannot reach the entire addresable market.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ok to be unpopular. In fact I would argue that being unpopular is the only way to happiness, financial sustainability, and the ability to sleep peacefully at night.</p>
<p>Popularity is eventually depressing, and mostly, a myth.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>When the first generation iPad Pro was released I saw two opportunities for my personal workflow. One was the easy, and simply beautiful, method for my couples to sign their Australian marriage paperwork electronically. The other was for me to leave my Mac at home with my heavy travel schedule and make the iPad the computer I took away from the house.</p>
<p>The iPad served both of those roles quite adequately, even more so as I upgraded to the 11&quot; iPad Pro and the second generation Apple Pencil.</p>
<p>The niggling feeling I&rsquo;ve had for the past year though, has been that I was too closely involved with the iPad, so much so that I couldn&rsquo;t see it&rsquo;s flaws, and the unhealthy relationship we&rsquo;d developed.</p>
<p>Things like: finding peace with transferring a 4K video off an SD card into the iPad and there being no status update as to how much of the file has transferred or how much longer it will take; struggling with the multi-tasking two-three apps open at once strategy called Split View and how it never really worked that well; how so many developers seemingly don&rsquo;t actually use an iPad despite developing apps for it, displayed usually by the lack of iPad feature support, or forcing us to use it in portrait mode when there&rsquo;s a keyboard attached and it&rsquo;s in landscape mode; and finally, so many developers just refusing to develop for the iPad, Instagram most notably.</p>
<p>So two products were launched this year that had a real shot at replacing the iPad and my entire computing setup.</p>
<p>The first was the <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2020/11/28/hours-with-a.html">MacBook running on Apple Silicon</a>. It runs <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2020/11/29/not-all-ios.html">iOS-only apps better than an iPad</a>, and it brings the responsiveness and the speed of the iPad, to the Mac, rendering my 16&quot; MacBook Pro with an Intel chip, obsolete. The only thing the MacBook Air with Apple Silicon did not do was give me touch and stylus.</p>
<h2 id="enter-remarkable-2">Enter, reMarkable 2.</h2>
<p>So I gave in and ordered a <a href="https://remarkable.com">reMarkable</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="first-looks">First looks</h2>
<p>The reMarkable 2, or the Remarkable as I&rsquo;ll refer to it from here on out, is a beautiful product, packaged beautifully.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="set-up">Set up</h2>
<p>The Remarkable syncs with the propriety cloud service, reMarkable Cloud.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And is supported by desktop and mobile apps.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Files can be uploaded to the cloud, and when the device connects to wifi, it synchronises back and forth.</p>
<h2 id="using-remarkable">Using reMarkable</h2>
<p>The device is beautiful to use. It&rsquo;s a simple, single-use, device. It displays documents and allows you to mark them up. Imagine a regular paper notebook married to that stack of documents on your desk.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The handwriting detection is pretty amazing well, considering my handwriting is more like a scrawl.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The unit also dabbles as a PDF reader and eBook reader, a task it handles well despite not being a Kindle. I&rsquo;d love to have access to my Kindle library!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="compared-to-the-ipad-pro-11">Compared to the iPad Pro 11&quot;?</h2>
<p>The Remarkable is 100% a nicer device to hold in your hand, and to write on. I&rsquo;m using the stylus that has an eraser in the head of the stylus, and the screen is what <a href="https://paperlike.com/products/paperlike-for-ipad">Paperlike</a> has been trying to bring to the Apple tablet family.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I find the Remarkable easier to write on, annotate with, and hold in my hand - with or without the leather case - the only problem is that it&rsquo;s not running iPadOS and it doesn&rsquo;t have an LTE modem.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re trying to imagine what it feels like, imagine a large and thin Kindle you can draw on.</p>
<h2 id="size-and-weight">Size and weight</h2>
<p>The Remarkable 2 is 187mm wide, 246mm high x 4.7 mm thick, compared to an A4 piece of paper, 210mm wide, 297mm high, and you know how thick it is. Compared to the iPad Pro 11&quot;, which is 179mm wide, 248mm high, and 5.9 mm thick.</p>
<p>The iPad Pro 11&quot; is actually the thinnest Apple computer ever made, but it feels like a brick after holding the Remarkable in your hand.</p>
<p>The Remarkable weighs 404 grams, and the iPad is 473 grams, 69 grams heavier, a 17% increase in weight as you weigh them up in your hands.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certianly nicer to hold the Remarkable, and especially when you factor in covers, cases, or keyboards. The Smart Keyboard really bulks out the iPad, whilst the Remarkable&rsquo;s leather folio is still quite slim and lovely to hold.</p>
<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>
<p>The reMarkable 2 will only connect to &ldquo;regular&rdquo; wifi networks, not public wifi networks requiring authentication through a website, like the Qantas Free Wifi.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And the Mac software is the slightest bit buggy, but the developers have promised fix.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="will-it-do-the-job">Will it do the job?</h2>
<p>The reMarkable 2 is replacing my iPad Pro. It might not have a 4G modem, Dropbox sync, or the Kindle app, but it is the best electronic ink tablet with a stylus money can buy right now.</p>

<p>If the reMarkable guys are reading this, I&rsquo;ll throw in a last minute request for a Safari extension as well, not all of us use Chrome :).</p>

		<a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2020/12/06/bullish-on-airbnb.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-12-06 20:32:00 &#43;1000">Dec 6, 2020</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Airbnb&rsquo;s strength today and in a post-covid travel world is in it&rsquo;s flexibility to offering a different kind of travel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Airbnb’s “gross daily rate” was pretty flat at the end of last year, hovering around $110. This, too, declined in April. But by June, it had increased to $146, and has since settled to a rate around 20% higher than last year — $128 in September.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Airbnb in 2020 would be one of the least affected-by-Covid companies on the planet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;One of my favorite taglines in recent memory was Airbnb’s “Live There,” a campaign it launched in 2017 with the agency TBWA. It’s as cheesy as any earnest brand campaign. But it feels true. A real representation of the Airbnb spirit, something its frequent customers can appreciate. Airbnb-ing isn’t remotely the same as staying in a lame chain hotel in a tourist quarter.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And he shares an interesting story about why Airbnb probably isn&rsquo;t the best and biggest travel content creator today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In late 2012, Airbnb launched a product called “Neighborhoods”,” he wrote, “which offered users incredibly rich and unique content about individual neighborhoods around the world. Visitors loved it. Almost too much. It turned out the content was so interesting that it distracted visitors from actually booking. When the team removed it from the home page, bookings went up.”</p>

			 <p>What do I actually do?</p>
<p>I lead my whole life in preparation to be your celebrant. Living the joy in my own marriage, leading my family, enjoying my friendships, travelling, living, drinking, sleeping, and eating, preparing for this succinct and breathtaking moment in your wedding. We’ll have meetings, breakfasts, lunches, dinners, coffees and beers. We email, talk, text, and DM, over months and years.</p>
<p>You walk down this aisle, everyone cheers, and then the crowd hushes.</p>
<p>You’re standing here, holding hands, and everyone waits for me to start talking.</p>
<p>What do I say? How do I say it? What vibe do I leave? How long do I speak for? Will it be too long or too short? Do I say and pronounce your name correctly? Will my PA speaker system actually work? How will everyone feel? Will I do anything awkward or weird? Do you trust me? What kind of marriage are we talking about?</p>
<p>It all comes down to that moment where I bring the microphone to my mouth and starting dropping syllables.</p>
<p>Someone watching me create a ceremony recently said that I just “ad-libbed” the ceremony because I didn’t read from a script. It’s so much more than that. I have to stand there confident about what I’m going to say after asking myself all those questions I just mentioned, and do it with a calm and happy demeanour, without burying my face and voice in a script.</p>
<p>I arrive an hour or more early, and I wait while you’re late, then stay around after to help with group photos or to help your Nanna to the reception.</p>
<p>I live an entire life preparing for these 18-minute-long moments we call a marriage ceremony. And it’s amazing, I’m so grateful I get to be that guy. Thank you for inviting me in.</p>

For those who feel powerless, they provide agency: I have the power to reject “experts” and expose hidden cabals. As Cass Sunstein of Harvard Law School points out, they provide liberation: If I imagine my foes are completely malevolent, then I can use any tactic I want.”</p>

<p>You can still engage in private conversation with people, maybe even in groups up to 5 or 10. But above a certain number even group chats are banned.</p>

<h2 id="instagram">Instagram</h2>
<p>Despite being disallowed by the developers, a little .ipa workaround saw Instagram&rsquo;s iOS app easily install on the Mac. The app is flawless from my using, scrolling, posting, and clicking around. The two glaring issues with this experience are that iPadOS&rsquo;s dealing with iPhone-only apps is dismal, and that Instagram&rsquo;s developers have a deep need to keep Insta off the desktop and tablet.

<p>The iOS apps that will shine on Apple Silicon Macs are the ones developed to the very spec of Apple&rsquo;s Huamn Interface Guidelines and everything else ever preached at a WWDC session.

			 <p>This is a black magic machine that is fast and beautiful and literally what I want in a computer.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/11/m1-macs-review/">reviews are all true and accurate</a>. Even for the bottom tier of Apple&rsquo;s computer lineup, this is the speediest, most responsive Mac I&rsquo;ve ever owned or used. Early in the year I moved to a Macbook Pro 16&quot; to get the speed and responsiveness I&rsquo;m getting from this MacBook Air, and the 16&quot; feels like a dinosaur.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s whimiscal to be running iOS/iPadOS apps right on my Mac. It makes me wonder why it&rsquo;s such a terrible user experience for iPadOS to run iPhone apps when it&rsquo;s downright lovely on a MacBook Air.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The only thing to wait for now is for developers to move their apps from Intel to Universal architetures so they run even faster, and to see what on earth more professional, progressive, and well cooled Apple computers can look like.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gone from the highest spec&rsquo;d portable Apple portable computer running an Intel processor, to what will undoubtedly become the slowest Apple Silicon Mac ever released, and it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;ve gone from crawling to walking.</p>
<p>The future is bright for Apple computers.</p>

			 <p>The <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/people-and-communities/marriages-and-divorces-australia/2019">latest Australian marriage statistics</a> have been released, strap in for some nerdiness! Thanks to my <a href="https://celebrant.institute">Celebrant Institute</a> colleague, Sarah for her help deciphering these numbers.</p>
<p>Saturday October 19, 2019 - that was the most popular day to be married in Australia last year. In the most popular season, whilst March was the most popular month, and all marriages were down 4.5% from 2018 to 2019.</p>
<p>The big change was that marriages by civil celebrants continue to increase, with 80.3% of all marriage ceremonies in 2019 created by a civil celebrant.</p>
<p>And the early data from the ABS shows an almost 32% drop in marriages for the first half of this year.</p>
<p>When comparing counts of marriages between April and June with averages for the same period over the past five years (2015-2019), in 2020 marriages were down 62%.</p>
<p>Quick side note, queer marriages were thought to have boomed in 2018 and settled down in number in 2019, but they’ve stayed about the same, from 5.5% in 2018 to 4.9% in 2019.</p>

			 <p>Only a few moons ago here in Australia the conservative and rather religious politicans embodied by the oddly named &lsquo;Liberal Party of Australia&rsquo; fought tooth and nail against marriage equality. A former leader of that party, who also once identified as the Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Turnbull, said on Four Corners:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There is no question that some of the most trenchant opponents of same sex marriage - all in the name of traditional marriage - were at the same time enthusiast practitioners of traditional adultery. The controversy over same sex marriage was dripping with hypocrisy and the pools were deepest at the feet of the sanctimonious.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before this marriage equality debacle, a rabbi who has never made any comments on marriage equality, despite his heavy teachings on so many other topics, commented on these politicans. Originally hailing from Nazareth, Jesus <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2023&amp;version=NIV">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when you have succeeded, you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are.&quot;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Social media encourages the myth that who we are is defined by the opinions we type. But the older I get, the less interested I am in how well people can script their beliefs in front of a computer and the more interested I am in how tenaciously they go about grinding out their moral existence. I’m impressed when someone can get up every single day, determined to be a better human being than he or she was yesterday. Typing out what we “stand for” is easy. But loving well isn’t. I am not down on typing out our opinions—clearly. I’m only down on thinking that typing in and of itself constitutes an ethical life. May we stop thinking that becoming the kind of person we want to be is as easy as typing “me too” at those we agree with and “stupid people” at those we don’t. That’s a distraction from the real work of being human. And I’m ready to work.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>The first two things I saw in the outside world this morning were about Sean Connery. One post was announcing his death. Another was reminding us of his misogynistic past.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a weird thing to reconcile the day after someone dies. To see that they were a person, loved by so many, yet they were flawed and broken in so many ways.</p>
<p>I think Sean Connery needs our grace.</p>
<p>My hope, my prayer, my meditation, my personal goal, the thing I&rsquo;d ask you to embrace in 2021, is grace.</p>
<p>Grace as a secular concept embodies a courtesy. Goodwill extended to you even though commonly it might not be. The Christian concept extends it further, allowing mercy without merit.</p>
<p>Grace isn&rsquo;t forgetting, it&rsquo;s not even forgiving really. It&rsquo;s not an eraser or coverup. It&rsquo;s not a cancel and it&rsquo;s not imagining that nothing happened.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s acceptance of what has been, allowing for the consequences of those activities, and building a bridge to the now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an acknowledgement of humanity, our weaknesses and our insecurities, and an olive branch through them. Not past, or over, or under, but through.</p>
<p>May grace lace my every word in the year ahead.</p>
<p>It’s what I need. It’s what my marriage, family, business, and friendships need. I’m willing to bet it’s what you need. Let’s give it freely.</p>
<p>Grace.</p>

			 <p>I upgraded my daily carry computer, or what us old people call a phone, to an iPhone 12 Pro this week. Upon clicking the shutter a few times I could see there was a big difference in the new camera, but I wanted to compare photos to former iPhone cameras. So I pulled out all the old iPhones in the house and took the same photo on each one. It worked out pretty good as the four cameras were each mostly two years apart in release dates.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="control-notes">Control notes</h2>
<p>All photos were taken on the iPhone with a fresh install, no apps, or settings changed, no iCloud logged in. I simply tapped to focus and expose inside the default camera app, and turned off flash for consistency. All phones were held in a Peak Design Travel Tripod with the phone attachement. I tried to keep the framing consistent, but if it&rsquo;s not, either the iPhone lens placement changed, or this free blog post doesn&rsquo;t live up to even my standards. The iPhone SE is the first generation SE, the 12 is a 12 Pro. Taken with default settings including HDR/Smart HDR/HDR 3, on the 1x lens. The only edits made are to the HEIC files taken on cameras which save HEIC, those files have been converted to JPG using MacOS Automator.</p>
<p>You may want to right click on images and open in a new window to see full resolution, and honestly, I&rsquo;m unsure if micro.blog actually compresses and/or resizes files so if you can still read this line I haven&rsquo;t edited with original uploads to somewhere else.</p>
<h2 id="cameras-used">Cameras used</h2>
<ul>
<li>iPhone 6, released September 19, 2014, 8MP f/2.2</li>

			 <p>2016 really does feel like a lifetime ago. I was in Iceland, having just been to Berlin and we were enroute to Paris, the first time I had ever married anyone in Europe. It was a pretty epic trip. I remember landing in Hong Kong from Paris and everyone got phone service. It was like landing and finding out a national disaster had occured, but Donald Trump had been elected President of the United States of America.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, “Closer,” by the Chainsmokers, was the country’s No. 1 song, as it had been since August. Not to read too much into that or anything, especially considering the duo’s troubling recent history of social distancing violations, but this lyrical snippet is standing out as pretty meaningful to me in 2020: “Four years, no calls/ Now you’re looking pretty in a hotel bar.” What if the thing looking pretty in the hotel bar … was democracy?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In their most outrageous form, the ads feature Palmer’s United Australia party candidates (such as his wife) urging electors to “Stop Labor’s 20% Death Tax”. Labor has no policy to reintroduce a tax on bequests, however large the inheritance, anywhere in Australia. The framing, the rising inflection in the speaker’s voice and the faux specificity of the claim are all designed to arouse emotion and credulity, by diverting attention from its factual baselessness.</p>

			 <p>The iPhone 12 Pro in-hand feel is remarkably different to the past six generations of iPhone with the rounded edges. The 90 degree edge of the iPhone 12 makes it feel better in-hand and I could imagine using it case-less.</p>
<p>12 Pro camera quality increase is so noticeable from an iPhone XS, the HDR is borderline &ldquo;too much” as far as regular photos go, but it&rsquo;s also representative of what we actually see with our eyes.</p>
<p>MagSafe is but another entry to the lineup of Apple things that &ldquo;just works&rdquo; and you&rsquo;d hope it would.</p>
<p>MagSafe cases and accessories are in low supply this early, but I&rsquo;m excited to see how vendors innovate, like <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/peak-design/mobile-by-peak-design-phone-cases-mounts-chargers-magsafe">Peak Design is on Kickstarter</a>.</p>
<p>Considering the rounded bump is no longer pushing out the width, the screen feels more edge to edge, the entire phone just looks beautiful. I&rsquo;m rocking the new deep blue colour.</p>
<p>Moving from an iPhone XS, the only thing I&rsquo;m mourning is 3D Touch/Force Touch. I apparently used it a lot more than I could remember. Long touch isn&rsquo;t quite the same.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re on an iPhone 11, the 12 is a splurge. If you&rsquo;re moving from an iPhone XS/XR, it&rsquo;s real nice. From a X or 8, or earlier, you&rsquo;ll be grateful for the numerous improvements. If you&rsquo;re on Android, congrats on reading so far into the review!</p>

			 <p>One of my earliest memories is listening to Play School on the ABC because I&rsquo;d been given a TV that didn&rsquo;t show a picture.</p>
<p>The medium of audio storytelling has been a passion of mine for so long, I found a career in it first in community radio, then in commercial radio as a techie and then as a breakfast announcer.</p>
<p>As podcasting became a thing, thanks Cameron, I have held a steady interest the entire time.</p>
<p>As the market for podcasts developed, the market split in half can be roughly described like this:</p>
<p>The first kind of podcasts are well-produced news, entertainment, and information podcasts. They&rsquo;re sharp sounding, and well made.</p>
<p>The second kind is my favourite kind. They&rsquo;re simple, people in conversation, drawing me into that conversation without ever knowing me. I&rsquo;m unashamedly standing in an audience, yet I feel connected to those people. It&rsquo;s a nice connection.</p>
<p><a href="https://atp.fm/">Accidental Tech Podcast</a> is one of those second kind of podcasts, and in their <a href="https://atp.fm/400">400th</a> episode, at the end of the episode, in the post-show, they talk about this kind of podcasting and why people like me have been listening for 400 episodes.</p>

			 <p>Anyone else struggling getting their head in a good and peaceful place at the moment?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lukefletcherphoto.com">Luke Fletcher</a> just sent me this pic of Luna from this time last year when we were in New York together for <a href="https://elopementcollective.com">an elopement with The Elopement Collective</a>.</p>
<p>My brain is in a constant state of change, one minute thinking about how nice it is to be at home and to pick Luna up from kindy, next minute I’m thinking about the 44 of our couples who have booked us but don’t have a new date yet and the 180 movements our couples have made to their wedding and elopement plans around the globe, then my mind wanders to the administrative nightmare that is my computer and my inbox and how I should probably accidentally drop the MacBook into a pond to save me cleaning up the files on the desktop, and before long my mind wanders to the reality of our 2020 and where we were supposed to be have been right now, and how a little virus has changed all that. From there it’s not long before I start thinking about the government policies around it all, and what that means for the state of our society and how our futures will all be dramatically different.</p>
<p>I feel such an emotional burden for our couples, for the people contacting me about new wedding plans, and so many of my friends that are battling the same burdens.</p>
<p>Like my own personal antenna in my mind is tuning into everything going on everywhere, so much noise, chaos, and pure humanity. It’s beautiful, and strange, and chaotic, and weird.</p>
<p>It’s a weird 2020, and I feel like it’s going to be a weird 2021, I’m not sure my head will ever be in a peaceful place again.</p>
<p>Shout out to <a href="https://robbell.podbean.com/e/you-and-your-antenna/">Rob Bell for his podcast about our antennas</a>. It was a weird embrace to acknowledge where my head is at today.</p>
<p>It’s a strange time to be a <a href="https://joshwithers.com.au">guy who stands in the middle of your marriage ceremony</a> and breathes your marriage to life.</p>

			 <p>The most friction in my life this year is my longing desire to see the sun finally set on 2020, whilst also acknowledging my deep desire to be present today, to be aware of what I am learning as running a wedding business becomes ever harder, how I am developing as I attend court mediations on the phone or have hard conversations with people, what weaknesses are being exposed when it all becomes too much, and which relationships really matter when you decide who to call or text about what’s going on, through this pandemic.</p>
<p>Not that the actual illness has affected me, I’m healthy apart from bloody hay fever, but in protecting ourselves and our community from the virus, we’ve lost so much else.</p>
<p>It’s a weird situation. Every day I see people commenting about Covid policies, and I can’t help but feel that if we stopped and took a deep breath that we might draw closer together as a community through this instead of forming deeper divisions between us depending on which politician you think is better.</p>

			 <p>Politics takes up a lot of our mindshare today.</p>
<p>Lots of people agreeing with a policy, politician, or party, or disagreeing with.</p>
<p>I don’t think that’s how it’s supposed to work. The joke about “there’s only two types of people” is a joke for a reason.</p>
<p>It’s not supposed to be an us and them situation, where you’re either for or against Dan Andrews, or the Liberal Party, or Trump, or lockdowns.</p>
<p>It’s so lazy to outsource our societal creativity, community problem solving, love for others, to a select group of politicians.</p>
<p>I want to be in the room, wrestling over the ideas, lovingly disagreeing, or not even disagreeing, but agreeing through gritted teeth because we can see the greater good despite the pain it might cause elsewhere.</p>
<p>Don’t put yourself, or me, against others over politics. The policy, the community, our society, deserve better than two teams battling it out to be right.</p>
<p>The truth is, if all you want to be is correct, to be cheering for the right team, prepare to be disappointed.</p>
<p>I don’t want to be on the right team. I’d just like to be the annoying guy on your team.</p>

			 <p>I’m not one to try to remember the darker, weirder, less enjoyable moments of life.</p>
<p>But today, while I was having a meeting with a couple I’m marrying next year, an angry bloke named Mark walked in and threatened to bash me up in the middle of the cafe.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mark posted in the Facebook Group<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about how Coles Supermarkets were closed today because of a computer issue, and commented that this is why we need to always carry cash etc.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I bantered with him a bit, became quite cheeky, and teased him for being a boomer. I was a bit of a douchebag.</p>
<p>He threatened to find me and fight me.</p>
<p>I saw a hurting middle aged guy named Mark, not some violent thug. So I offered up that I would be at my local cafe, Sisterhood Coffee, and although I would not and could not fight, I was available to meet and chat.</p>
<p>He arrived and made a big scene. The Police came and we made a report.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I posted the below in the Facebook Group before leaving it, and the sentiment remains for all. I don’t have much to offer this world, but if your alone and angry - online or off - I’m often available to be your friend.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Facebook Group Post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A thing I never thought would happen, happened today. A member of this Facebook group walked into Sisterhood Coffee threatening to bash me up. A formal report&rsquo;s been made with the Police and I guess they&rsquo;ll find him and talk to him. But I&rsquo;m seriously saddened by the state of our community. That some banter on a Facebook group about how Coles was closed and about a cashless society, resulted in a middle aged man resorting to violence. We make big claims in this Facebook group about the light rail, youths, or tradies, ruining Palm Beach, the truth is, we&rsquo;re ruining Palm Beach, by being so emotionally disconnected, so spiritually void, that we feel the need to go into a fist fight in a cafe over cheeky Facebook comments.
Mark, if you see this, my call to come to the coffee shop to talk was genuine. If you want to fight, I can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ll be bashing up a useless guy. But if you want a friend, I&rsquo;m guessing you&rsquo;ll be able to find me again.
Seriously, if any of you are feeling that alone, sad, and divided that we resort to inhumane violence, I live in Palm Beach and I&rsquo;d like to be your friend. Please don&rsquo;t bash me up though. You&rsquo;ll be leaving a pregnant wife and two year old daughter with a wounded dad, and you&rsquo;ll be left with the legacy of missing out on having a real connection with another person on the planet.</p>

			 <p>On the chance that you were wondering how the different levels of government in Australia worked, in the 19th century all the states we now know as Australia (and for a second there, almost Fiji and New Zealand) agreed to federate, but all the states would keep their governments.</p>
<p>They agreed to give these powers to the new federal government though, as you can <a href="http://www6.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s51.html">read in section 51 of the Constitution</a>. Local governments are different again, each state’s Local Government Act determines what the councils can do.</p>
<p>So that’s the weird thing about Australia. The Prime Minister parades around like he’s Kingpin but he’s basically working for the states on a little to-do list put together 120 years ago.</p>
<p>Every now and then the PM has a nuanced little opportunity to flex some muscle with money, but basically the state Premiers are the real MVPs.</p>
<p>In hindsight it’s quite the odd system. If you were starting fresh today you’d probably design a country very differently.</p>

			 <p>So many of my couples are on their third, fourth, or even fifth wedding plan.</p>
<p>The couple I am marrying today had originally booked me and The Elopement Collective for the Amalfi Coast.</p>
<p>When we all realised that Italy 2020 wasn&rsquo;t happening, we kept on hearing talk of a New Zealand travel bubble so we planned for a September elopement in Queenstown.</p>
<p>Then when that bubble was never realised, and Jetstar cancelled our flights, we brought it closer to home, and planned to elope in the Blue Mountains. Then NSW was cut off.</p>
<p>So this afternoon in good ol&rsquo; Queensland, in the Sunshine Coast hinterland they&rsquo;ll finally get married.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got similar stories for so many people, with so many emails, so many text messages and phone calls.</p>
<p>The interesting part is that they&rsquo;re not overly sexy stories, nor are they terribly sad stories, I can imagine some people thinking &ldquo;Wah wahh, you can&rsquo;t get married in Amalfi&rdquo;, but these are real stories out of 2020. Between the bushfires, the pandemic, the travel cancellations, the lockdowns, the people who have shut down their businesses - some for good - and those who are out of work, hold a heavy trove of stories. Britt and I are supposed to be in California today getting ready for an elopement in Yosemite.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a weird old year.</p>

			 <p>Hi, I’m Josh.</p>
<p>I’m a marriage celebrant.</p>
<p>I believe that the best part of your wedding should be your ceremony, and I work my ass off to make one that fits like a glove.</p>
<p>I think that if you had no arbour, cake, flowers, cars, photos, seats, decorations, suits, or white wedding uniforms/dresses, that it’s still an epic day because you are loved. Everything else is just sweet sweet sugar on top.</p>
<p>I think personal vows are powerful, and personalised dressing robes are cool.</p>
<p>I fly a drone (DJI Mavic 2 Pro) and I like making photos of things that aren’t people. I like 90s pop and alt rock and 2000’s Foo Fighters.</p>
<p>I’ve got a 23 month old daughter named Luna, another little girl here in February, and every day of mine is brighter because of Britt, my wife. She’s the brain behind the The Elopement Collective!</p>
<p>We live at Palm Beach on the Gold Coast, and if there’s not a pandemic I normally travel the globe creating epic marriage ceremonies.</p>
<p>I’d love to make yours!</p>

			 <p>It’s been 183 days since the first postponement email. The longest 183 days of my life.
154 displaced weddings and elopements.
Some couples are onto their third, fourth, and fifth wedding or elopement date or location.
46 cancelled flights to 15 different countries.
$67,200 in cancelled invoices for future elopements or weddings.
Thousands more lost to non-refundable accomodation, ferries, etc and about $20,000 tied up in travel vouchers. If anyone wants to fly Brussels Airlines before December 31 I’ve got some vouchers.
Who knows the actual real cost to our business (me + The Elopement Collective).
3 court appearances coming up because we couldn’t refund and the couple didn’t want to reschedule.</p>
<p>1 virus.</p>
<p>I’m ready for all of this to be over now.
How has Covid-19 affected you?</p>

			 <p>Five Darwin observations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Where the goal for people in many cultures is to become a doctor or a lawyer, in Darwin it’s to become an air-conditioning salesperson or refrigeration mechanic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The true status symbol of greatness in Darwin is to drive a dust-stained Toyota 4WD. Everyone else is a lesser than.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are an inordinate number of retired airstrips in the region, which would be really helpful if you had lots of planes you needed to land at once.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The flies here are much more motivated than the common fly in the rest of Australia. The territory flies have a deep-rooted belief that your skin is merely masking the best thing a fly could ever want, like searching for the proverbial pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, flies are intent for getting literally under your skin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a coffee conspiracy in Darwin. My current understanding is that a mean person banned good coffee beans from ever coming to Darwin and if you are visiting there is a thriving black market for smuggled quality coffee beans. This is a guaranteed method of instant wealth.</p>
</li>

			 <p>I thought I&rsquo;d take the time to tell you an old story from the first time I ever thought about a wedding, it was actually 25 years ago this month.</p>
<p>So on this one faithful August night in 1995, I was about to propose to my girlfriend when my roommate Joseph barged onto the verandah out of nowhere, tripped and fell over, breaking a glass outdoor table with his face.</p>
<p>Totally ruined the mood.</p>
<p>Now, I didn&rsquo;t know Joseph that well, I can&rsquo;t even remember where he was from, but I&rsquo;m sure you could imagine I put my plans on hold to help get him to the hospital.</p>
<p>Joseph had gotten big glass shard in his eye leaving him completely blind in that eye. He was walking around with one of those cotton pads on his eye for a couple of months. Then suddenly, he disappeared, along with my girlfriend!</p>
<p>Apparently they&rsquo;d bonded during the time after his injuries, and they eloped together, leaving me behind without as much as a note. I tried to track them down, but never could.</p>
<p>As happy as I am today, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for cotton eye Joe, I&rsquo;d have been married a long time ago.</p>
<p>Where did you come from, where did you go? Where did you come from, cotton eye Joe?</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In 1998 the German electro pop band, Scooter, released an absolute banger of an anthem called “How Much Is The Fish?”</p>
<p>I enjoyed this track immensely serving its place as the post-alt-rock 1990’s soother my library was in need of.</p>
<p>Somewhere around 2003 I realised I wasn’t ok with a (misheard) lyric “transforming the Jews” and i filed Scooter away as nazis.</p>
<p>Today Supertramp’s Logical Song was referenced in a podcast, so I turned to my music library to relive the 70s melody. From there I remembered that Scooter released a remix/cover of that song which I revisited, and then pivoted to that scar of a song, How Much Is The Fish?</p>
<p>Turns out Scooter aren’t nazis. They’re transforming the “tunes” and they’re ok with Jews.</p>
<p>I still don’t know how much the fish is.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before we get too hung up on blaming the state govt, or the federal govt, or China for our covid situation let’s review some facts:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We had to bring in mandatory quarantining in hotels, because we couldn’t trust people to stay home after returning from overseas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We then had to bring in security, because we couldn’t trust people to stay in those hotels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We then had to bring in ADF, because we couldn’t trust the security guards not to have sex with those in quarantine in the hotels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We had to get police to door knock and check up on people, because we couldnt trust those who were meant to be self-isolating to actually stay at home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We also have to have police and ADF reinforce the metropolitan melb zone and state borders, because we can’t trust people to follow the restrictions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are now being asked to use masks, because we cannot trust people to social distance when they are in public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Through it all, our supermarkets have had to introduce shopping restrictions because we couldn’t trust people to not to take more than what they needed.”</p>

			 <p>This screenshot contains two passwords I used to use, maybe 10 years ago. The username and passwords were released in a data dump, and because I am registered with <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com">haveibeenpwned.com</a> they let me know today.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t used those passwords for ages, because I now use a password manager - 1Password - which generates unique passwords for each website I use.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a smart guy, and I know if I&rsquo;m being scammed or phished, but sometime in the past decade or so I was had - and that that username and password is now available to the general public.</p>
<p>Two things I&rsquo;d love for you to take away from this:</p>
<ol>
<li>This is why it&rsquo;s important to have unique passwords for every service, because if one service is breached, then the potential fallout for you personally is limited to that one company. If you use the same username and password for everything, then if one company is breached, hackers now have access to all of your websites and logons.</li>
<li>Have a look through the <a href="http://demo.zeeroq.com/email/combos.vip-me.com.txt">publicly available list of usernames and passwords</a> just to get a feel of how unique your password for all of your life is.</li>

			 <p>Throughout this COVID time of life I didn&rsquo;t know where to go with my podcast, <a href="https://therebels.guide">The Rebels&rsquo; Guide To Getting Married</a>.</p>
<p>Then I was listening to my friend&rsquo;s podcast, <a href="https://eftm.com">Trevor Long&rsquo;s EFTM podcast</a>, and he&rsquo;d started taking calls helping people with tech support and tech buying decisions, and I realised that I used to do that for a living - take phone calls on the radio. So I&rsquo;ve taken The Rebels&rsquo; Guide to a talk radio kind of format. Think of it like talkback radio for weddings!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a bit rusty on my radio skills, it&rsquo;s only been a decade, but here&rsquo;s my first episode back, I hope you love it :)</p>
<p>Search for &lsquo;The Rebels Guide To Getting Married&rsquo; on your favourite podcast app, including Spotify, to listen on your phone.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>My mother-in-law asked for my help seting up a new laptop, a Dell XPS 13 2-in-1, and for the first time in a long time I was sat with a Windows laptop in front of me.</p>
<p>My intial impressions using her machine was that it wasn&rsquo;t all bad.</p>
<p>And having used a new 16&quot; MacBook Pro for the past few weeks, and finding more and more that MacOS wasn&rsquo;t the JesusOS I thought it was, I wanted to give Windows 10 a go.</p>
<p>So Boot Camp was run, Windows 10 was installed, and I&rsquo;m a few hours into the experiment.</p>
<p>A few thoughts: Microsoft Edge is a silent achiever; Windows is a mostly ok operating system these days; mouse/trackpad in Windows still sucks; the 16&quot; Macbook Pro trackpad is very large and Windows doesn&rsquo;t have palm-rejection so I hate it and want to throw the laptop away everytime my right hand&rsquo;s palm graces the bottom right of the trackpad; there&rsquo;s many cross-platform apps available, but apparently I love a lot of Mac-only apps (like Drafts, Tot, Spark); Touch ID on MacOS is a missed feature; Preview.app is a silent achiever on MacOS and is dearly missed; Apple&rsquo;s Windows software is pretty good on first look; remapping some keys on the keyboard will make life easier; 1Password on Windows is actually a better experience than on Mac &hellip; how did Windows get a better 1Password than Mac?; I need to remap the Apple Command key to the Windows CTRL key immediatly after publishing this post (use Sharp Keys for this one); who knew that Windows had a built-in clipboard manager?!</p>
<p>One takeaway anyone should have reading this is that Microsoft Edge is actually a really good web browser, a non-Google but Chromium-based web browser, and it&rsquo;s worth you trying.</p>
<p>The biggest thing I&rsquo;m missing today &hellip; iMessage. That little &ldquo;social network&rdquo; is a powerful ecosystem lock-in.</p>

			 <p>So look, I don&rsquo;t want to be &rsquo;that guy&rsquo;, but two of the higher profile cases of COVID-19 test in Australia - the bloke in Blackwater, and the Black Lives Matter protestor - are people who&rsquo;s initial tests were positive, then secondary tests came back negative.
Is there at all the slightest chance that this whole COVID thing needs a bit of critical analysis done on it?
Slightest possibility that we, as a people, could apply critical thinking and maybe pull back on the fear and the craziness?
Reckon we could open some borders, and get some businesses back to work?
I&rsquo;ll be over here in the ranty corner, have a great day.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Six years on, there are wedding industry peeps still saying they invented pop up weddings, and although everyone is welcome to the phrase (we missed out on the trademark) I wanted to honour Britt in staking our claim in thinking of it.</p>
<p>Who disrupted the wedding industry with pop up weddings? Britany Withers invented pop up weddings.</p>
<p>Britt, aka my wife, thought of the idea in late 2013, I went live with them in early 2014 flailing about trying to figure out how to make them work, and then Britt left her job and joined me full time.</p>
<p>We transitioned from the brand Pop Up Weddings to The Elopement Collective because the brand was so heavily copied and we&rsquo;d missed the opportunity to trademark it. Plus, Britt didn&rsquo;t like my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/wUsNHoFb6Z/">graphic design</a>. Businesses were popping up every day using the words &ldquo;pop up wedding&rdquo; and most meant something different to what we intended, plus all of them were cheap and tacky, lacking the class, simplicity, and beauty we brought to the space.</p>
<p>Everyone else that does pop up weddings today is welcome to them, but don&rsquo;t claim to have thought of it and disrupted the wedding industry yourself.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a few news articles from the time: <a href="https://www.watoday.com.au/national/western-australia/perth-pop-up-weddings-come-to-town-20140423-373px.html">WAToday</a>, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2780967/Pop-trend-growing-demand-laid-weddings-couple-says-I-Do-alleyway-city-centre.html">The Daily Mail</a>, <a href="https://www.hitched.com.au/wedding-planning/organising-and-planning/pop-up-weddings-explained_478.htm">Hitched</a>, <a href="https://www.intimateweddings.com/blog/pop-wedding/">Intimate Weddings</a>, or just scroll back to the very start of the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/elopementcollective/">@elopementcollective</a> Instagram account, it used to be called @popupwed.</p>
<p>I also just did the old scrolly back through Instagram and here&rsquo;s some highlights, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/wQU954Fb8y/">December 6, 2014</a>, when we started transitioning to what we now call The Elopement Collective. That time we took <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/xJC5lYlb6y/">pop up weddings to Hawaii</a>, visited the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/yvr53Vlb7h/">White Magazine offices</a>, but most importantly, that <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/k1AL-vFb1r/">February 1 first post on Instagram</a> that told the story of the fabled first pop up wedding, where we actually made a loss and could only convince <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/mO9QDvFb5D/">one couple, one lovely couple, to get married</a> at a pop up wedding. The second event, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/lv4QqXFb9J/">set for Star Wars Day</a> had zero bookings but it did get us on <a href="https://youtu.be/YdVuM0UHHr4">Seven&rsquo;s Sunrise TV show</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m allowed to boast about my wife, it&rsquo;s socially acceptable to cheer on your favourite human, so I wanted to end on this note. Most people only have the chance to revoloutinise an industry once, but Britt, she not only brought pop up weddings to the wedding industry, she then went on to <a href="https://elopementcollective.com">specialise in elopements with The Elopement Collective</a>. The EC is a market leader, she was first, and she&rsquo;s the best in her field. Every major market now has someone packaging elopements and you can draw a line back to Britt from all of those innovators.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a pretty amazing girl my wife.</p>

			 <p>You’re A Miracle (And A Pain In The Ass) by Mike McHargue is an important book for the humans of Planet Earth.</p>
<p>It’s not important for the ground breaking research or scientific findings it contains, they’re accurately credited to the many smart people that found them in years past.</p>
<p>This book is important because of the important narrative that Mike weaves through the understanding that we humans are beautifully fantastic miracles, yet in so many countless ways thanks to our brains, childhood trauma, and the hyper connected world we live in today, we are massive pains in the asses.</p>
<p>Reading this book has given me so much insight into my own behaviours and just plain old stupid stuff I do everyday.</p>
<p>Thank you for writing this book, Mike 🙏🏻</p>

			 <p>The internet used to be lovely.</p>
<p>Call it nostalgia, but two of the &ldquo;former generation&rdquo; tools that I think made the internet so lovely was RSS and blogs.</p>
<p>Of course, both still exist today, but they&rsquo;re most definitely not the primary means of sharing and storytelling. So this week when TTThis shared <a href="http://tttthis.com/blog/if-i-could-bring-one-thing-back-to-the-internet-it-would-be-blogs">&ldquo;If I could bring one thing back to the internet it would be blogs&rdquo;</a> and Daniel Miessler wrote <a href="https://danielmiessler.com/blog/its-time-to-get-back-into-rss/">&ldquo;It’s Time to Get Back Into RSS&rdquo;</a> I felt like I wasn&rsquo;t alone in those nostaglic feelings.</p>
<p>Feelings that hark back to a time when the internet was inherently beautiful, with some ugly parts; whereas today it feels like it&rsquo;s inherently ugly, with some beautiful parts.</p>
<p>As guilty as I stand here being the Facebooking, Tweeting, Newsfeeding, Redditing, boy that I am, I can&rsquo;t help but feel like all those services are just adding to that vibe that WALL-E predicted, where we&rsquo;re all just fat content absorbing sobs on hoverboards, instead of the intellectual humans we were born to be.</p>

			 <p>Tomorrow is my 11th celebrant birthday, 11 years a celebrant, wow, and today I&rsquo;ve been thinking about all the funny/stupid things the wedding industry bought into my world over the last 11 years.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a few that have been rattling around in my head.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s hilarious how far photographers and videographers will go to make it look like no vendors, including the celebrant, were ever at the wedding. I see some wedding photo galleries and films, and there&rsquo;s not even a slither of my arm in frame lol. What&rsquo;s with the weird fantasy that no-one was working on a wedding?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You&rsquo;d be surprised how much time of my time is spent confirming which year a wedding enquiry is for, and where the wedding is going to be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There&rsquo;s a heavy link between people who won&rsquo;t pay a fee that allows me to maintain a sustainable business, that will still be operating when their wedding comes around, and people who are in Facebook groups after their wedding bitching about how terrible their wedding vendors were.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facebook Groups are the devil.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The best wedding vendors have an inner drive to be better. They&rsquo;re attending workshops, listening to podcasts, upgrading their gear, learning, teaching, mentoring, being mentored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wedding vendors who aren&rsquo;t doing those things are probably in a Facebook Group undercutting everyone on price then leaving the wedding industry in a year because &ldquo;brides are <em>expletive</em>&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I once had a groom&rsquo;s dad threaten to beat me up before a ceremony. I&rsquo;m always keeping one eye on the groom&rsquo;s parents at a wedding, statistically speaking, they&rsquo;re the crazy ones there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think a lot about how in the context of planning a wedding, the words &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; and &ldquo;formal&rdquo; actually don&rsquo;t mean anything. People say they want a completely non-traditional wedding then do all the traditional things, and people say they don&rsquo;t want a formal wedding but state a dress code as black tie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At weddings, more than half the time I&rsquo;m there I&rsquo;m trying to patiently wait for things, without looking like I&rsquo;m waiting. At these times I&rsquo;m normally singing Wiggles songs inside my head.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, beware of anyone who says they &ldquo;love weddings&rdquo;. No sane person &ldquo;loves weddings&rdquo;. Sane people love that person A and person B are getting married, and that is being celebrated at a wedding, but across the board weddings can be some of the strangest, weirdest, and most wonderful things you could ever see. I&rsquo;m surprised there aren&rsquo;t more reality TV shows about weddings. In-fact, I&rsquo;m surprised I haven&rsquo;t paid a camera crew to follow me around, it&rsquo;d be a rip-snorter of a TV show. Sane people don&rsquo;t love weddings, but they love being a part of the creative process that makes a moment where two people can get married in a special and meaningful way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facebook Groups are evil.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Listen to my podcast, The Rebels&rsquo; Guide To Getting Married, because honestly, someone has to listen to it otherwise it&rsquo;s probably just going to get archived by the podcast host.</p>
</li>
</ul>

		<a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2020/05/10/when-a-bushfire.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-05-10 20:27:11 &#43;1000">May 10, 2020</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I drove through a recently bushfire affected region last week. The ground was still blackened, but not as much as the tree trunks. The foliage and grass that would normally cover the bush floor was slowly achingly coming back to something that resembled life, and those trees that survived, still stood tall.</p>
<p>The stand out from the drive though were the two things flourishing today.</p>
<p>The weeds.
The surviving trees.</p>
<p>I’m guessing the weeds were the first ones in after the fire trucks rolled out. They love abusing the voids in our society, the empty holes, the spare ground, the unused lots. There will always be weeds, in the bush, and in business. We can’t change the weeds, and history tells us that any concerted effort to introduce other species to eradicate weeds, is a plan fraught with danger and failure. The best way to get rid of weeds is to make the rest of the garden/forest/marketplace as healthy as possible because then there’s no room for weeds.</p>
<p>As for the surviving trees though, they were the most impressive displays.</p>
<p>Obviously their trunks were burnt, and their spirits were dampened, but they metaphorically held their breath long enough for the bushfire to burn through and today thanks to their deep roots, and their strong trunks, they had the leaves just inside them ready to spring out back to action when the fires calmed, the rains came, and the sun shone again.</p>
<p>Any efforts to regrow during the bushfire would have just resulted in more burns.
But today those deep rooted, strong trunked, trees are alive with the deepest colours springing out of their leaves.</p>
<p>Be the surviving tree.
Be a part of a healthy forest.
This too shall pass.</p>

			 <p>The range of hardware seemingly now known as iPhone SE is in some ways the last hurrah for a generation of iPhone.</p>
<p>The iPhone SE 2016 was the ultimate of the iPhone 4/5/5S line, and the iPhone SE 2020 is the ultimate 6/6S/7/8.</p>
<p>John Gruber <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/04/the_2020_iphone_se">says it well</a> in his 2020 model review, &ldquo;Like the iPhone 5-style 2016 iPhone SE before it, the new iPhone 6-style iPhone SE feels like the canonical ideal of the form factor it embodies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The iPhone SE of 2023 or 2024 will no doubt be the ultimate, best-of, version of the iPhone X/XS/11 range.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve heard a few people say that they run out of ideas on what to post on their business&rsquo; social media accounts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a long history in daily content creation, I did it on breakfast radio for three hours a day every workday for a decade, and today I do it across all of our businesses.</p>
<p>My strategy is to be multi-discipline in my creation, to aim to reach people in many places in many different ways, whilst aiming to be at least inspiring, educational, entertaining, relevant, and demonstrable, if not all five.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re one of those people looking for a kick up the content butt, commit to a 29 day challenge in February</p>
<p>$29 for 29 days of content creation challenges in the 29 Day Club. Sign up at <a href="https://29days.substack.com">29days.substack.com</a> and the first email goes out on February 1.</p>

			 <p>Here&rsquo;s a (hopefully) possible and good idea for Apple and the FBI.
Instead of Apple building unhealthy encryption-breaking backdoors and the FBI <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/01/08/fbi-apple-pensacola-shooter">generally complaining about iPhone security</a>, what if iOS often looked for a wifi network that it could always backup to.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s called &ldquo;Apple Backup&rdquo; and if a phone has power and it sees that network, it knows the password because Apple has decided the password is something like P@ssw0rd, and when all those stars align the phone backs up to iCloud. Law enforcement agencies can then take the opportunity to take the regular route of making a request through a court to Apple for that data in iCloud.</p>

			 <p>Just under three years ago I flew a drone for the first time, and started clicking the shutter button. I had no idea what I was doing, and luckily the original Mavic Pro camera operated at about the same level of tech as an iPhone camera.</p>
<p>I never knew what to do with the photos I made.</p>
<p>I shared them on social media, which was lovely. Some of them even got 10 likes!</p>
<p>I invested in an online gallery, well, a few online galleries, and I sold about three prints.</p>
<p>I submitted photos to stock photo libraries, but nothing really sold there. You can find me on Getty, iStock, Stocksy, all making about zero dollars a year.</p>
<p>So then there’s Unsplash, which feels like a melting pot of loser photographers like me, where the photos I made have earned me zero dollars, I know that over 40 million people have at least seen the photos. About 200,000 people have downloaded and used my photos. <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/76YjW4gEAsI">This particular one</a> has been viewed over 4 million times in the past 4 days.</p>
<p>Money’s nice, and exposure doesn’t pay the bills, but there’s something about my nothing becoming something, something about being seen, that fills my heart up.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2019/10/24/the-news-in.html">The news in Australia is under siege</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2019/10/24/the-news-in.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-10-24 19:56:09 &#43;1000">Oct 24, 2019</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Well-produced, true, meaningful, helpful, locally relevant, news and information publishing/distribution that isn&rsquo;t rooted in fear or control, is under siege.</p>
<p>Four stories about the news are on my mind today.</p>
<p>The first is about Newsweek, once a stable of American news publishing. Today however, <a href="https://www.cjr.org/special_report/newsweek.php">the publication is fighting</a>, not for life, but for clicks, views, and dollars, all whilst whittling away what trust anyone had in its pages. The lede for the story tells it all: “No one working at Newsweek can tell me why it still exists.” Newsweek used to set the agenda, now it writes viral headlines that Google will throw searchers to.</p>
<p>The second is about a radio station where I worked for about two years, Brisbane&rsquo;s news and talk radio station 4BC. The <a href="https://www.couriermail.com.au/business/macquarie-media-appears-set-to-relocate-4bc-to-mt-coottha-but-it-could-mean-redundancies/news-story/964a6316ed236bd28de3c6671fb2d056">Courier Mail reports</a> that the automation computer that identfies as a &lsquo;radio station&rsquo; is moving to its new owner&rsquo;s premises, Channel Nine&rsquo;s Brisbane studios. When I was there the radio station was local from 5am to midnight, with every single hour on-air being dedicated to creating content that informed and helped the Brisbane community. Now it&rsquo;s just a Sydney radio station that plays Brisbane ads in between. There was a team of producers scouring the region for great stories to tell, and a newsroom dedicated to describing the current state of Brisbane. The radio station once had a massive staff, and now 4BC is literally  a computer with a soundcard.</p>
<p>The third is from Stratechery&rsquo;s Ben Thompson in his article <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/the-internet-and-the-third-estate/">The Internet and the Third Estate</a>: “The first three estates are commonly thought to be the three branches of government: the executive, legislative, and judicial. It is the press that holds all three accountable, and in Zuckerberg’s telling, the Fifth Estate that gives everyone else a voice.” Ben goes on in great detail about how the first, second, and third estates, across America and Europe have not only evolved over time, but been the cause for great changes in power. <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahfrier/status/1184908897196429314?s=12">Mark Zuckerberg</a> is really pushing for Facebook to lead the fifth estate revolution that can only end terribly, because social media doesn&rsquo;t make you an asshole, you already were one and social media can shine a light on it.</p>
<p>The fourth story is simply how Australian newspapers this week <a href="https://www.reuters.com/video/2019/10/21/australian-papers-redact-front-pages-in?videoId=615634882">redacted</a> their front pages in protest to the limitations our federal government has been imposing on the press.</p>
<p>Many of us are indulging in retrospection as we mourn the news as we knew it, but the fourth estate, and the fifth, as we once knew it wasn&rsquo;t the healthiest lion in the pride. 4BC was launched so that John Chandler, of Chandlers fame, <a href="http://blogs.slq.qld.gov.au/slq-today/2015/04/08/john-beals-chandler-and-4bc-radio/">could sell more radios</a>. Many Australian newspapers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/03/magazine/rupert-murdoch-fox-news-trump.html">find their roots in manipulative power and control</a>, instead of the noble cause of telling the news as it is. <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2003/11/19/facemash-creator-survives-ad-board-the/">Facebook started</a> as Mark Zuckerberg&rsquo;s answer to finding out whether girls really were hot, or not.</p>
<p>Meanwhile there is a community trying to wring something good out of the bloody cloth that we have known as the news. Organisations like The Guardian, New Matilda, and Crikey, are working on new and different business models for the news while Australia&rsquo;s publicly provided media, the ABC and SBS, are being <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-10-23/abc-boss-confirms-staff-to-go-following-budget-cuts/11629336">defunded</a> quicker than our Prime Minister can ask &lsquo;<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-08-06/secretive-government-agency-linked-to-afp-raid-on-abc-foi-shows/11387618">how good</a> is the media?!&rsquo;</p>
<p>In an industry plauged by so much corruption, failing business models, and excessive noise, the future of the news looks bleak and on fire.</p>
<p>But I wonder if what we need is for the entire house to burn down so we can actually rebuild on the remaining foundations?</p>

			<h1><a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2019/10/03/on-travelling-to.html">On travelling to New York with a baby</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Many have messaged us about travelling with a baby, so I thought I’d share a few thoughts about bringing Lu to New York.</p>
<p>So firstly, we’re not travelling with a baby, we’re travelling with Luna, she’s almost a fully formed influencer with diet shakes and essential oils ready to sell you. Seriously though, Luna’s just one of us, eating the food we eat, going to the places we go.</p>
<p>Secondly, prams in New York are a bit tough if you want to take the subway. We’re rocking a Babyzen YoYo which I recommend highly, but you’ve got to carry it up and down the stairs. The rare subway station has an elevator, but most don’t. Lord knows how people in wheelchairs get around.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the drug stores and supermarkets here have some pretty good baby food. At home we make her food, but out here she’ll eat off our plate but mainly she’ll demolish/suck the organic goodness out of the plastic sleeves Whole Foods sells.</p>
<p>Finally, I appreciate the slightly slower pace a baby brings. Too many people want to see New York in a day. It just doesn’t work like that, and having to stop for nappy changes, sidewalk bottles, or not leaving the Airbnb until after her first nap is a reminder to take it slow and to smell the roses (or the stench on the sidewalk).</p>

<p>Isle Marry You – for celebrants who do weddings on islands.</p>
<p>Aeiou – a stock standard vow service.</p>
<p>I Donut – a rebrand for the celebrant trying work less so they can spend more time with their family and donuts.</p>
<p>I Due – a celebrant who specialises in weddings for pregnant women.</p>
<p>Something Burrowed – for the Cooper Pedy celebrant.</p>
<p>Canaloupe – a celebrant who can offer elopements and also likes fruit puns.</p>
<p>Meowied By Name – if you&rsquo;re a cat lady and a celebrant.</p>
<p>Maui&rsquo;d By Name - for celebrants on the island of Maui.</p>
<p>In Tents Ceremonies – a celebrant service that offers really intense ceremonies but is packaged with a tipi.</p>
<p>For Butter Or Worse – for a celebrant who is out of the ordindairy.</p>
<p>Pitcher Perfect Weddings – one if you&rsquo;re a wedding photographer who also brews beer and serves it in your photo shoot.</p>

			 <p>Laguna Quays and the Turtle Point Golf Course is classical 1990s Queensland foreign investment gone bad. My favourite is the international airport which got as far as a runway missing bitumen. It went into receivership and it hasn’t changed much since I first saw it abandoned in January 2012. Photos shot today, August 11, 2019.</p>

			 <p>Posting a hot Apple theory I just imagined because in 5 to 10 years time, when it comes true, I want to link back to this post to proclaim how right and intelligent I was for a second.</p>
<p>The iPhone has a short life ahead of it. The iPad is encroaching the iPhone&rsquo;s purpose on one side, and the Watch on the other. On the side of that note, the iPad is also taking up the oxygen in the market the MacBook is leaving, and the MacBook is going to retract to a desktop/home computer. So, the Apple Watch is becoming more and more powerful, and will take the &ldquo;central processing unit&rdquo; elements the iPhone currently provides to your personal computing life and interconnectivity.</p>
<p>The iPhone fades away, you&rsquo;ve got an Apple Watch on your wrist, and an iPad in your backpack, and the breathing room left in the market is a camera. You don&rsquo;t want to be taking photos on your 10.5&quot; iPad and the Watch is too small to take a good photo. Does Apple leave cameras to third party manufacturers like it has monitors and wifi routers? No, it loves the camera.</p>
<p>From May 2018, my bold prediction for the future of Apple is an Apple Camera.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most of the design tolerances of the Model 3 are already better than any other car in the world. Soon, they will all be better. This is not enough. We will keep going until the Model 3 build precision is a factor of ten better than any other car in the world. I am not kidding.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Our car needs to be designed and built with such accuracy and precision that, if an owner measures dimensions, panel gaps and flushness, and their measurements don’t match the Model 3 specs, it just means that their measuring tape is wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Some parts suppliers will be unwilling or unable to achieve this level of precision. I understand that this will be considered an unreasonable request by some. That’s ok, there are lots of other car companies with much lower standards. They just can’t work with Tesla.</p>

		<a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2018/04/13/qantas-vs-virgin.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-04-13 15:58:26 &#43;1000">Apr 13, 2018</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In the last year I&rsquo;ve been trying out both Qantas and Virgin. I simply wondered why so many of my friends were Virgin frequent flyers.</p>
<p>After reaching Virgin Gold thanks to a status challenge from Qantas Platinum, I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;m going to continue to keep status with Qantas. Before I list the issues with Virgin, a positive note is the extra flights and lounge opening times out of Gold Coast airport. The Qantas GC lounge isn&rsquo;t open for early morning Jetstar International flights and even only opens one hour before the early morning Qantas flights. But on every other note Virgin is only an average airline. My biggest complaint being the 23kg luggage limit even for Gold frequent flyers (my PA system is 32kg). But other issues are the protein bars they call meals, their inflight entertainment app is buggy, and their iOS app is buggier. Plus, the Sydney Virgin terminal, T2, is a pain compared to Terminal 3 for Qantas in Sydney.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a Virgin flyer, you might want to know about the <a href="https://www.ausbt.com.au/qantas-secret-fast-track-to-platinum-gold-frequent-flyer-status">Qantas Tier Accelerator</a></p>

			 <p>Broadcasters and content-creators have their own problems with Facebook&rsquo;s newsfeed changes at the moment, and that’s why Twitter is a strong prospect for social sharing, building your brand, being amazing and encouraging your target demographic to #JoinTheConversation.</p>
<p>Most social media training that exists today is focused on brands that sell products or services, not brands that wholly and solely create content. So here’s my list of things that radio stations should be tweeting this year.</p>
<p>If you can tick off every item on this list in the next month you&rsquo;re well on your way to 140 character success.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Start, or re-start, a personal Twitter account and actively use it. Simple. Follow people, unfollow people, search hashtags and local issues, find out who the popular Twitter users are in your town and say hi. Immerse yourself in the Twitterverse so you know what floats and what sinks in the firehose that is Twitter.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Above and beyond celebrity access you’ve got skilled journalists, media professionals that have lived in the area for years, reputable researchers and talented individuals, right inside your building with access to a Twitter account. Use those resources to craft a tweet that no-one else can tweet.</p>
<p>This includes historical items, longer form opinion on news pieces, breaking news, traffic information, contextual traffic information that delvers not only fact but reason. Music stations also have some of the world’s biggest music nerds, if a song’s on air, tweet a factoid about the song with a listen live link.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Twitter is a now medium, what was tweeted before now almost certainly does not have a long half-life. Very few tweets get on the retweet bandwagon that lasts for days or weeks.</p>
<p>So with that in mind, if you tweeted something amazing, even a link to some of your content, tweet it again later, later that day, later that week, later that month.</p>
<p>Start using a few of the tools that help you manage this service as well. Tweetdeck, Buffer, Hootsuite, Coschedule are just some of the tools you can use to help you ‘tweet later’.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Arfter all,if you can’t get it wright let someone else get they’re rocks off on Twiitter.</p>

			 <p>Most people spend Boxing Day battling the sales or consuming mass amounts of sports on TV, but me, I drop my wife off at the shopping centre and have a few thoughts over a long black.</p>
<p>This morning I was thinking about how radio could be different in 2014 and the Albert Einstein line “Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.” came to mind.</p>
<p>If you’ve worked with me before you might recognise some of these from conversations or proposals gone past. They all ended up in the “crazy ideas” bin, so feel free to take them if you like, these ideas are all yours.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A great piece of programming that for a few seconds differentiated it from Nova, 973, Spotify, Pandora, iTunes Radio, 96five and whatever was on DAB.</p>
<p>Now that Nova has replaced Novanation with Coles Radio (is that what happened on Christmas Eve?) why not launch a new radio format in the face of ARN’s CHR attack, a DJ style nonstop mix, that happy and uplifting style of music that you hear on the Surfers Paradise Boulevard on Summer Saturday afternoons.</p>
<p>Heck, just give DJ Goodwill 24 hours a day, he’d rock it! In fact, give half to Konsky, half to Goodwill.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The high horse of the quality broadcasting studio is great, but what if your news guy is live from that crash that just happened for the 2pm bulletin, then one talent is hanging out with the families at that massive local park checking out what they’re doing and making a quick package out of it then your other talent is on a yacht for the Sydney to Hobart, or something absolutely crazy that breaks all the rules of radio but makes it more local than it’s ever been.</p>
<p>One of the rising stars of the 2013 radio industry is Nic Kelly and although he’s a shining star in studio you should see him on the streets. If you gave him a wage, a car, a camera guy, and a producer I think you’d be pleasantly surprised with his airchecks.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The Fairfax radio apps deliver the station’s content in an above-average manner and the new SCA apps are pretty cool, but they have all missed the mark on one main thing: two-way communication and delivering a better-than-radio experience.</p>
<p>If your radio station app doesn’t allow me to send a sound bite of my opinion, a video of that crash that just happened, a “text message” of feedback or to vote on a poll, why does it even exist? I can listen on the hundreds of other radio apps.</p>
<p>Also, the producer that’s producing the show on air right now should be able to put the poll up and receive the soundbites or other content. If an engineer or &ldquo;web guy&rdquo; needs to be involved you’re not doing it right.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I don’t know if they do that with every ad but would the Good Guys, Harvey Norman and that guy from National Tiles get a run on a station sounding that good?</p>
<p>Here’s my little challenge: produce adverts in the mind that they’re getting played on a certain station and they sound at home on that station amongst the other ads that all have that same format.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Firstly, there are some amazing podcasters in your very city. In Melbourne hundreds of thousands of people listen to some of the city’s little known comedians on podcast. Even my and Steve’s podcast the “Thing Committee” has been listened to over 350,000 times. Those kind of numbers on commercial radio would warrant ears being raised. But on podcast it’s the normal. Our podcast isn’t even “popular”  with those kind of numbers</p>
<p>Secondly, you’ve got some really talented people in your building and they might not be hosting breakfast. Almost everyone in the station has been behind the mic, or would like to be, so why not workshop some niche shows they could produce on a weekly basis, record in the spare studio and put out on the station website. Imagine the possibilities!</p>
<p>You’ve got the resources and the skills, so why not do it?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But with that said, we’d all like to increase our business traffic and revenue, so if your advertising makes us money, doesn’t cost us money, then we’d love to hear from you some time.</p>
<p>Seriously, who is sales talking to?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I tuned into the talk stations and those particular presenters on that day felt way out of my care-factor space. They were people who bitched and moaned about “kids these days”.</p>
<p>Here’s a tip: some “kids these days” like to listen to talk radio but we resort to podcasts to listen to our peers because the old fuddies on the radio quite often leave us with a sour taste in our mouth.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I didn’t grow up in Brisbane but now call it home and I legitimately wanted to know who Obie was and why he had a segment every morning. And I worked there.</p>
<p>Obie’s probably a great bloke but I listened every morning and could never figure out who he was or what he did.</p>
<p>Listeners want to join the boys club, but we’d like an invitation.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I challenge someone to do something absolutely crazy on DAB, something that would create talk and lead the charge on DAB receiver sales.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>She doesn’t even check the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->people.com<!-- raw HTML omitted --> app, it’s not as good as the website she tells me.</p>
<p>Britt is demographically right in the middle of the B105 target, she even likes radio, we met because she missed my breakfast radio show when I left, but she doesn’t care for Scoopla or anything of that feel on B105.</p>
<p>I don’t know what the answer is, but it’s not whatever is happening right now.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here’s the key though: when you play it back don’t apologise about how it’s something old. Back yourself, just play it with no apologies. If it’s good content then it’s got legs for months.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Regional radio is just so much more important to it’s community. Jay and Dave in Mackay, Wayne in Esperance or Glenney in Kalgoorlie are the underrated heroes of their communities and they deserve a pay-rise, extra resources and a promotions budget.</p>
<p>It’s just a damn shame if they don’t get it and end up in real estate like most regional radio superstars do.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The greatest void on the Internet today is in original, relevant, relational, quality content.</p>
<p>Yep - what you do on air is missing online. You can connect the dots right?</p>

			 <p>Some of my best friends are quitters.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->And amongst most people I know that wouldn’t be a positive statement. To be a quitter in modern Australia goes against every little battler’s great Aussie Dream. ‘Quitters never win and winners never quit’ is the popular encouragement that you’ll hear coaches say, and even the cast members of Glee sing ‘Don’t stop believing’ as an encouragement to nerds worldwide.</p>
<p>But why is it so bad to quit?</p>
<p>I look over my close friends list on Facebook, think back over the coffees, lunches and dinners I’ve had recently, and skim through the text messages and phone calls I’ve received and my closest allies are quitters, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>
<p>I think about my friend Ash who quit his working life two years ago to go to university, and Evan who’s recently done the same thing. Lawrence quit plumbing to go to mining, and he even quit his marriage. Britt quit buying more handbags for travel, and she quit calling me split-the-bill Josh and started calling me her husband. Scotty quit his lifetime dream to do something that he thought mattered. Téa quit Perth to go to Sydney and Andrew quit the single life to become a dad and a husband. From what I know, they&rsquo;re all much happier now, especially Britt!</p>
<p>There’s something beautiful, strong, endearing and proud about admitting publicly that a thing is not the right thing, and now you’re choosing a different thing.</p>
<p>Why don’t you quit something today?</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m arguably the most hopeless person you&rsquo;ve met. Just ask Ash, or Lawrence or anyone else that knows me well. Hopeless.</p>
<p>I dream big though.</p>
<p>365 days ago, my dreams became words. And my words became messages. And those messages became a relationship. And that relationship became a marriage.</p>
<p>One year on I&rsquo;m happier than I&rsquo;ve ever been. I&rsquo;ve never felt so fulfilled, content and loved.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve still got about nine months until we celebrate our first wedding anniversary, but one year ago I wasn&rsquo;t Britt&rsquo;s boyfriend, and that all changed at 6pm on the 4th of December.</p>
<p>Since that moment she has occupied my every thought. She&rsquo;s pretty cool.</p>
<p>I love you baby.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Ships in the night are not unlike the plethora of music today, always passing you by. Songs plastered across Youtube, Spotify, iTunes, in retail stores, on bittorrent, the radio and TV, it&rsquo;s hard to trust someone even when you see the album being played on their Facebook page almost every day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Mat Kearney&rsquo;s fourth album, &ldquo;Young Love&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve played on Spotify this week and I wanted to explain to all my friends why it&rsquo;s worth a listen or ten.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s my top ten reasons why Mat Kearney deserves your ear-time this month.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On the songwriter scale of Carly Rae Jepsen to King David, Mat Kearney&rsquo;s not far from the top. His songs are authentic and humble stories that will inspire you and leave you with that good feeling in your gut.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s toured with John Mayer, Sheryl Crow, MuteMath, Keane and Owl City, performed on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno twice, and this summer in the United states he&rsquo;s opening for Train!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to hear the track &ldquo;Rochester&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s about Mat&rsquo;s grandfather. Mat tells the story of his Dad growing up &ldquo;I&rsquo;m actually named Matthew William Kearney, my middle name is named after my grandfather. My grandfather raised my dad in Rochester, N.Y., and he had a fake cigar shop and he ran an illegal gambling ring out of the back of it&rdquo; and meeting his mother who was &ldquo;a mermaid on a glass-bottom boat&rdquo;. A beautiful story that needs to be heard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the opening track Mat pulls out a Roland 808 and drops the stereotypical singer-songwriter style and makes a rocking pop tune called Hey Mama.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ships in the Night has spent 14 weeks in the Hot 25 national music chart based on your votes and radio airplay!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before Mat was a singer-songwriter he was a poet and he didn&rsquo;t even know it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are no puns like the last point on the album.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mat&rsquo;s songwriting is a very organic process &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t force them to come. They come as you listen, and meditate and pray, and wait for those songs, really. That&rsquo;s the challenging part of what I do. You can&rsquo;t just show up 9-5 and are guaranteed that a good song comes. Some of the songs fall out of the sky—they existed before I had it&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mat was married last year and the theme of many of the songs, and the title of the album is born out of his newly found &ldquo;Young Love&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you&rsquo;re still not convinced or you haven&rsquo;t heard of Mat Kearney yet then you&rsquo;ve probably heard his songs on the soundtracks for Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy, One Tree Hill and Bones!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Get &ldquo;Young Love&rdquo; today online or at your lcoal music store and your must listen tracks are 1, 2, 9 &amp; 10!</p>

			 <p>Bruno and Taylor, two brothers, saw two sisters with &ldquo;ghostly, haunting and honey sweet&rdquo; harmonies, playing at a campfire of all places. They talked, they jammed and now they play together in a band called The Vespers. If you didn’t know any better you would have imagined the storyline would include Bruno and Taylor courting Callie and Phoebe, just because that’s how these stories go, but I have it on good authority from the Bruno today that all four band members are single.</p>
<p>Normally the relationship status of band members isn’t something that would make it into one of my music reviews, but I wanted the question answered as much as you probably would have if I hadn’t of tweeted them to find out. While the band was tweeting me back and forth and I was listening to some early released tracks from the upcoming album “The Fourth Wall” I asked them what this latest album meant to them.</p>
<p>The Fourth Wall will be The Vespers second release, and it reeks of the kind of unity only siblings can know, the kind that’s really going to get up the girdle of other bands that are still squabbling over riffs and beats. The quartet is well toured around North America and this live element of their sound is something that guitarist, banjoist, accordionist, ukulele player and singer Phoebe is excited about getting into their recorded album, she says The Fourth Wall is not just a collection of songs, but a sound, the collective efforts of the four band members equally.</p>
<p>The second music video from the album, for the song Flower Flower will leave you happier than a pig in mud, but bassist Bruno hopes that you’d see the song and the whole album as a showcase of what the whole band is capable of and what their message is, not just a great folk beat and some amazing harmonies from the two sisters.</p>
<p>What is their message you ask? Well the band is hoping to tour our golden soil soon but for now you’ll need to spend the time listening to this infectious, youthful and spiritual folk/pop album from The Vespers, it’s called “The Fourth Wall” and it&rsquo;s out now.</p>

			 <p>[quote]Everyone’s looking for something. Sometimes it is home. Sometimes it’s that long lost love. Sometimes it’s God [/quote]</p>
<p>The mysteries of God and life is the self-imposed description given to me by Auckland singer-songwriter Stahan Coleman. One of the highlights of the recent Parachute Music Fesitval in Hamilton, Strahan’s honest song of the mysteries of God and life is more an alm to a tattered soul than an instruction or a message to be preached.</p>
<p>When you first take the CD out of the handmade case and press play on the CD player the acoustic-folk tunes may remind you of Leeland, Jon Foreman or even a brighter side of Stu Larsen, but Strahan carries his own story and his own beat aptly. Recorded with the help of New Zealand’s Dave Baxter of pop-rock band Avalanche City, Strahan’s EP Water &amp; Fire holds true to his raw style but sounds beautiful.</p>
<p>“The songs are an honest representation of where my hearts been at for some time, knowing that God can resurrect anyone and bring new life but waiting for him to bring it about” says Coleman.</p>
<p>Strahan continues on his Facebook page “These are not songs of a preacher. They’re not ballads to lilting love. These are just alms to that old, worn faith. Skin for the skeleton. The sound of someone looking for a resurrection. From the opening throes of ‘Hallelujah’ to the closing refrain of ‘Resurrection Song’, Water and Fire is the sound of someone who travels with dust on his feet, connected to the earth, but eyeing heaven. “</p>
<p>Expect an Australian tour from Strahan in the near future or grab his EP Water &amp; Fire now and enjoy a passionate worship experience with this kiwi folk kid.</p>

			 <p>When I first started with the company now known as Southern Cross Austereo in early 2004 I was simply stoked to be working in the industry. Since then I’ve been given opportunity after opportunity on group and local levels and after 7 years that has culminated in me having my dream career in Port Macquarie at the successful Mid coast Media Centre.</p>
<p>But 7 years away from family has kept me away from every birthday party, anniversary, milestone, Easters and many Christmases with my closest friends and my family so I&rsquo;m be leaving to be with my friends and family in Mackay. There&rsquo;s no ill feelings towards the company nor the office in Port Macquarie.</p>
<p>On that note, there&rsquo;s no job (at least not yet) in Mackay for me to go to. Sometimes you just need to have faith that you&rsquo;re doing the right thing &hellip; and if you aren&rsquo;t then it really doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone in Southern Cross Austereo, especially in recent times, the Esperance and Port Macquarie offices plus our respective hubs, for creating the company that let’s me have the most fun you can have while still getting paid a wage!</p>

			 <p>I had the recent opportunity to get Tony Abbott on the phone and on the air as he was in the area. His media advisor couldn&rsquo;t get him to the studio though (I know a kilometre is a long way Tony, think of it like a marathon) so instead we had a phone call lined up for 8:15am of the morning Wednesday, 28th of September.</p>
<p>The 5 minute audio recording from SoundCloud is below, here is the transcript.</p>
<p>[toggle title_open=&ldquo;Hide Transcript&rdquo; title_closed=&ldquo;View Full Transcript&rdquo; hide=&ldquo;yes&rdquo; border=&ldquo;yes&rdquo; style=&ldquo;default&rdquo;]TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR, INTERVIEW WITH JOSH AND STACE, STARFM, PORT MACQUARIE</p>
<p>Subjects: Visit to Port Macquarie; Julia Gillard.</p>
<p>PRESENTER: Joining us on the show this morning, the Leader of the Opposition Tony Abbott. Welcome to the show, sir.</p>
<p>TONY ABBOTT: Josh, it&rsquo;s nice to be with you again.</p>
<p>PRESENTER: So tell us, Tony, we know you&rsquo;re in our area but where are you right now?</p>
<p>TONY ABBOTT: Well, right now I&rsquo;m on Hastings Drive heading out towards the bridge and I&rsquo;m going up to Kempsey because there&rsquo;s an iconic Australian business at Kempsey, it&rsquo;s called Akubra hats and I&rsquo;ll be visiting them to talk about the red tape burdens which under the current federal government are falling on businesses and what the next Coalition government I hope will do to ease them.</p>
<p>PRESENTER: So just another day but perhaps with a hat?</p>
<p>TONY ABBOTT:Yes, that&rsquo;s right. I don&rsquo;t quite think I&rsquo;m going to have a Bob Katter hat on but no doubt I&rsquo;ll get a chance to model a few Akubras.</p>
<p>PRESENTER: Very good and then are you heading back south or are you heading north?</p>
<p>TONY ABBOTT: I&rsquo;m then off to Coffs Harbour because I&rsquo;ve got a community forum up there in Coffs, a bit like the one I did yesterday here in Port.</p>
<p>PRESENTER: Very good and that was a successful night last night?</p>
<p>TONY ABBOTT: Yeah, I think it was. You know, the great thing about these community forums is that people can raise whatever is on their mind and that&rsquo;s good because politicians spend a lot of time telling people what&rsquo;s on our minds and I think it&rsquo;s important that people get their chance to
talk back at us</p>
<p>PRESENTER: Well, Tony, you&rsquo;re on our radio programme this morning so I&rsquo;m going to let you say what&rsquo;s on your mind in a moment but I was hoping I could put a gateway challenge in, are you up for a challenge?</p>
<p>TONY ABBOTT: I&rsquo;m always up for a challenge, mate. If it&rsquo;s the half ironman or the full ironman in Port I&rsquo;m always happy for a challenge.</p>
<p>PRESENTER: Oh mate, this might be a double ironman. Tony, we&rsquo;ve got a 60 second timer here and I wanted to play a 60 second challenge with you.</p>
<p>TONY ABBOTT: Ok.</p>
<p>PRESENTER: And look, I don&rsquo;t think it will be that hard because back in the day when both yourself and Julia Gillard weren&rsquo;t in the leadership positions you are now you used to have a bit of friendly banter on the Today Show on Channel Nine.</p>
<p>TONY ABBOTT: That&rsquo;s exactly right, we did.</p>
<p>PRESENTER: And then look you often had something nice to say about Julia. I was only watching, there was a video that was all mashed together of the nice things you both had to say about each other so I reckon you&rsquo;ve got it in you. I&rsquo;m going to let you speak politics if you can complete the 60 second challenge where for 60 seconds it&rsquo;s you just complementing and saying nice things about Julia Gillard.</p>
<p>PRESENTER: Josh!</p>
<p>TONY ABBOTT: I&rsquo;ve got 60 seconds?</p>
<p>PRESENTER: 60 seconds and the timer is here so you&rsquo;ll know when it&rsquo;s up, ok.</p>
<p>TONY ABBOTT: I&rsquo;ve got to fill 60 seconds worth of airwaves with nice things about the Prime Minister?</p>
<p>PRESENTER: Yeah, well because, you know, I know you used to have nice things to say about her and often the only things that make it to the nightly news are the negative things but I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve got nice things to say about her.</p>
<p>TONY ABBOTT: So you want me to start off?</p>
<p>PRESENTER: Ok, I&rsquo;ll count you in.</p>
<p>PRESENTER: And the thing is Tony if you can make it then we&rsquo;re going to let you say whatever you want after that.</p>
<p>TONY ABBOTT: Alright, ok.</p>
<p>PRESENTER: Alright, 60 seconds starting now.</p>
<p>TONY ABBOTT: Ok, well look, I know Julia Gillard very well on a political basis and on a professional basis because I was the health minister when she was the shadow health minister, I was the leader of the House of Representatives when she was the manager of opposition business, she and I debated each other on the Today programme every Friday morning for most of 2007 and indeed for much of 2010. So I know her very well professionally and politically and there&rsquo;s no doubt that as an opposition shadow minister and as a deputy prime minister she gave you the impression of being very much on top of her job, very much someone who you could do business with and I think the problem since she&rsquo;s got the top job is that she has disappointed people who saw her in those earlier roles and assumed that she would just slot naturally into the top&hellip;.</p>
<p>Have I run out of time?</p>
<p>PRESENTER: You made it!</p>
<p>PRESENTER: Although it wasn&rsquo;t that nice, Tony.</p>
<p>PRESENTER: I thought you were going to take this opportunity to compliment her on perhaps her shoes&hellip;</p>
<p>PRESENTER: Hair colour&hellip;</p>
<p>TONY ABBOTT: I know better than to make any public comment whatsoever on what a woman wears.</p>
<p>PRESENTER: Well you did very well. This was Josh&rsquo;s challenge and I was a little bit sceptical but you handled it really well, Tony, so thank you.</p>
<p>TONY ABBOTT: Well thank you so much, Stace, thank you so much. So now I can say what I really think!</p>
<p>PRESENTER: Now you can say whatever you like!</p>
<p>PRESENTER: Tony, upon getting the phone call from your media guy yesterday, and I was telling my friends, there are a lot of people who are keen to see you in the leadership. Mate, I&rsquo;m going to wish you well and especially obviously over the next 12 months. I watch a little bit of the political stuff on the ABC and I know the next 12 months there are going to be a lot of change I reckon. Do you think we&rsquo;re going to have a female prime minister for Christmas?</p>
<p>TONY ABBOTT: Oh, that&rsquo;s in the hands of the Labor Party. I think there&rsquo;s a lot of unrest inside the Labor Party at the moment. I think a lot of people are looking both with apprehension and anticipation at Kevin Rudd. So look, who knows what&rsquo;s going to happen. They gave Kevin Rudd the flick because they thought he was doing a lousy job before the last election and at the moment they think that Julia, if anything, is doing a worse job. So that&rsquo;s why her position is so fragile at the moment.</p>
<p>PRESENTER: Tony Abbott, he&rsquo;s Leader of the Opposition, mate enjoy your day on the Macleay and then on the way up to Coffs Harbour region and thank you very much for joining the Star Morning Crew.</p>
<p>TONY ABBOTT: Thanks so much Josh.</p>
<p>[ends][/toggle]</p>
<p>[soundcloud url=&quot;<a href="http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/24300320">api.soundcloud.com/tracks/24&hellip;</a>&quot;]</p>
<p>My first thoughts are that Tony and my co-host Stacey is deaf  &ldquo;Well you did very well&rdquo;. When Tony says &ldquo;she has disappointed people&rdquo;, that isn&rsquo;t really all that nice. I&rsquo;m also a fan of me &ldquo;watching a little bit of the political stuff on ABC&rdquo;. So bogan right now.</p>
<p>I had hopes we would have had real life Tony on the phone (well actually in the studio), not political gamer Tony.</p>

<p>Mum always said you get what you pay for but ‘Wake Up and Sleep’ was worth so much more!</p>
<p>Deas Vail, pronounced ‘day-us vale”, is a rough translation of Latin and French meaning ‘servant of God’. The four boys plus Laura hail from Arkansas and they love music because it speaks to so many different people in so many different ways. The band is no stranger to the recording studio or the stage, having shared both with Owl City, John Reuben and Relient K in the past 8 years. They were signed by DC Talk’s Mark Lee Townsend in 2005 and more recently they moved to the infamous Gotee Records camp, under their Mono vs Stereo label headed up by the Matts from Relient K (Matt Hoopes and Matt Thiessen).</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>[quote float=&ldquo;right&rdquo;]are you waking up just to fall asleep again?[/quote] The most important thing you need to know about Deas Vail is how much you’re going to love them and their songs. Their October 11 album release is a 12-track voyage about life, freedom, love, hope, fear and transformation. Press play to get that instant positive uplift in the sweeping contours of the opening tracks, as ‘Desire’, ‘Sixteen’ and ‘Summer Forgets Me’ provide a powerful and emotional kick start to the record. Wesley’s vocals ride the guitars and drums like a bareback horse through the mountains, this is a beautiful recording. Their free release in “Wake Up and Sleep” is a friendly tune that leaves you with conviction and hope, something I think many of us could do with more of.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for that new album to fall in love with then catch Deas Vail’s self titled October 11 release. Or you can just wait and make hipster jokes about your friends that do. Did I mention it was being released on vinyl as well?</p>

			 <p>If you dreamt last night that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Owl City<!-- raw HTML omitted --> composed the soundtrack for Wes Anderson’s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou <!-- raw HTML omitted -->then you’ve probably already heard a few of the tracks off the second release from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Swimming With Dolphins<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Water Colours<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Formed in chilly Minnesota, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Swimming With Dolphins<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is the only band in Wikipedia that gets confused with a therapy technique which is ironic considering that Minnesota’s cold weather generally builds a platform for a melancholy performance but <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Water Colours<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a surprisingly bright and warm EP.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Swimming With Dolphins<!-- raw HTML omitted --> originally consisted of current lead man Austin Tofte and Owl City’s Adam Young, since their first release Adam focused on his solo project <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Owl City <!-- raw HTML omitted -->which is touring Australia this year and Austin focused his efforts away from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Owl City<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and onto <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Swimming With Dolphins<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Water Colours<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a smiling and friendly album that is the result of the two years of hard work from Austin. “I feel like the story of this record is &lsquo;challenge,&rsquo; right down to the lyrics and content, up to the actual release. We&rsquo;re pushing every button we can,” says Tofte “It&rsquo;s been an awesome ride, but I&rsquo;m so ready to have it out and be able to look back and say, &lsquo;Man, that was a heck of an effort.&rsquo;”</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->See You Soon’s<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Sarah Beintker brings her beautiful voice to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Holiday<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sleep to Dream<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, New York’s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sunsun <!-- raw HTML omitted -->also mixes up the chromosomes on the airy <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Happiness<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and Minnesota solo project <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Modsun<!-- raw HTML omitted --> joins Austin on the vocals track for the joyful final track on the EP <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Good Times<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Austin spent two years around Minnesota searching his soul and finding himself and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Water Colours<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is the result of this reflection, Austin reflects “It was just a long process, and quite honestly, probably longer than it should have been. You start second-guessing things you have too much time to work on,”.</p>
<p>After years of touring with Owl City plus two years of writing  Austin is ready to leave his Father’s farm “I&rsquo;m ready to be on the road. I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time writing and in the studio, and I&rsquo;ve got a band now, and we&rsquo;re all excited about it. It&rsquo;s awesome, I feel like we&rsquo;re going to have fun on this record, for a while, and it&rsquo;s been a long time coming. It feels like a new chapter.”</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It&rsquo;s been 365 days, to this very hour, since the Skywest Fokker 50 landed at Esperance Airport and my journey from the Gold Coast via Perth was complete.</p>
<p>Thinking back to that time I was so scared, but an overwhelming sense of excitement kept my temperature from reaching fever pitch. After seven years of various roles in the radio industry, my dream of &ldquo;working in a real radio station, on the air&rdquo; was finally being recognised. I&rsquo;d done so much volunteer work for community radio stations, aboriginal LPON and online plus my numerous opportunities at RG Capital/Macquarie Regional Radioworks in the IT and Engineering field and it had all added up to this.</p>
<p>Weeks earlier I had received a phone call asking me to apply for the position. I was at the Hillsong Conference in Sydney, enjoying a really good time with friends and lapping up the Sydney City culture and in the space of a few days I&rsquo;d been thrown three balls to juggle.</p>
<p>A church in North Queensland had offered me a great staff position doing what I was already doing at SURFCiTY Church, just in much better conditions with some people I really loved working with and plus I&rsquo;d be within minutes of family which was a real drawcard.</p>
<p>One of Australia&rsquo;s largest touring companies had asked me to submit a proposal to create a new division within that company, an online video archive of all of the great concerts they&rsquo;d promoted in the past and had video of plus also to live stream upcoming concerts and offer online concert tickets, a very exciting venture.</p>
<p>The third phone call came and the Group Program Director of Southern Cross Media knew that I had been really keen to get on air on one of his stations, I&rsquo;d continually email him and harass him stating so. He had passed my details on to the West Australia Group PD who then called me and let me know there was a job opportunity and I might like to apply.</p>
<p>When it rains it pours.</p>
<p>Suffice to say I ended up in Esperance, Western Australia based on a gut feeling, one year on and it&rsquo;s working out with a few social and relational hitches. I&rsquo;ve never had such a great opportunity to live my dream as I have had here, though I&rsquo;ve never been so far away from people that I loved, which I never would&rsquo;ve thought of as an pertinent issue.</p>
<p>I could list the numerous problems and issues I&rsquo;ve had, or address the dire loneliness I&rsquo;ve felt but it&rsquo;s all fickle and worthless. The loneliness isn&rsquo;t so much about being alone, but it&rsquo;s the residue, left over after relationships have deflated over the Nullarbor.</p>
<p>Where to from here? I&rsquo;ve got no idea, but I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll be in radio.</p>

			 <p>Fisherman, single guys and serial killers, they&rsquo;re the only ones who have &ldquo;the one who got away&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve been a single guy for a period that long that even God himself, when asked how long Josh has been single for, just says &ldquo;a long time&rdquo;, so in essence I&rsquo;m more than qualified to talk about this.</p>

<p>Too name one, I&rsquo;d go out and say Cassie Tesar-Keys. She lived down the road when I was in Grades 7 to 10 at Salonika Beach, south of Mackay. I spent a good three years trying to work up the courage to ask Cassie to go steady with me. We already pretended we were together on the bus so other boys wouldn&rsquo;t annoy her, we even practiced kissing once so that we&rsquo;d be ready for the big game whenever and wherever that might be.</p>
<p>Alas, my boyish lack of intelligence left us apart. We&rsquo;ll note that down as a weakness and move on ok?</p>

<p>I do website design, but it&rsquo;s nowhere near as creative, original and inspiring that Doddo, Tea Brennan and other web designing mates do - I&rsquo;m humbled when I see their work.

Then I&rsquo;ll try to write something that&rsquo;s not about me and I get three words, most probably clichés to boot.</p>

			 <p>Today another milestone was reached in my life, I was published in a ridgy didge newspaper! I hope this is the first in long line of them :)</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the article, the photo of it printed is below.</p>
<p>Esperance, the ninth wonder of the modern world, the only island not completely surrounded by water.</p>
<p>Well at least it feel a like an island sometimes, so it was a pleasant surprise to meet with Qantas management this week as they gauge community interest in the flying kangaroo landing in Esperance. The state government is deregulating the WA airline market in some places and re-regulating in others, this is the case in Esperance where an extra license will be issued soon. The meeting I sat in with the senior management of Qantas for West Australia had the stylings of a casual job interview, but Esperance was interviewing Qantas for the job of &lsquo;getting us to Perth and beyond!&rsquo;. We talked about how our town is growing and so are our needs, we just got a new McDonalds you know! And if the federal government is kind enough to the resource companies we might see more mines open soon. Our port (the largest nickel concentrates exporting Port in the southern hemisphere) is getting a new transport corridor, just like a grown-up port and the town’s foreshore is finally being stablised. There’s even talk of Coles and KFC coming to town, it’ll only be a matter of years until someone starts a rumour about David Jones opening at The Boulevard Shopping Centre.</p>
<p>Then Qantas told us about it&rsquo;s great services and frequent flyer points, we were getting along really well and it looked like we might give the job to Qantas! But then the stark realisation was that in the end it was the Perth based State Government&rsquo;s decision, as were most Esperance issues and we would have to wait for a crumb to fall from Master Barnett&rsquo;s table until anything happened, let&rsquo;s hope Esperance and the Southeast of WA doesn&rsquo;t need another contamination to get Perth&rsquo;s attention again. After all, there&rsquo;s much more to the Southeast than lead contamination and boat rescues, have you heard about sammy the sea lion and our beaches?</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve recently been informed that my credit card number has been listed on Google thanks to my friends at Blippy. Read the news article at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Venture Beat<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in two minds about the matter. Firstly, I&rsquo;m a radio host and comedian, so any hacker should know my credit card numbers are more useful to a collection agency than Google. Secondly, it&rsquo;s an honour to be listed in such a dishonourable way next to Leo Laporte. I pride myself on my early adoption of technology, including Blippy, and all early adopters know that when you play with fire, Google caches it. [Update: early reports said Leo Laprte was also one of the four users that were compromised, but I&rsquo;m not certain this is correct, which might make my blog post title awkward]</p>
<p>In recent times I&rsquo;ve actually removed my credit card sync with Blippy because my bank was mailing me my statement in a small box because of the extra number of transactions Blippy incurred. I hope that Blippy is doing everything in it&rsquo;s power to secure their systems for all other users. I&rsquo;m confident that my bank has sufficient procedures in place to stop credit card fraud and as a safety precaution I&rsquo;ll be ordering a new card.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone&rsquo;s inquiries, my story is for sale to the highest bidding TV network, I have a dramatised version that includes divorces and a possible Zombie plot just to keep the viewers interested.</p>

			 <p>Somewhere along the way, it might of been in a movie, probably in church, sometimes it&rsquo;s even just a friend, but somewhere along the line that is life I got too encouraged.</p>
<p>I was told I could do anything. There were various conditions applied to this, for example &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ve got the right attitude&rdquo; or &ldquo;if you believe in yourself&rdquo; or the classic &ldquo;if you work hard enough&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I even believed it. But as long as there are other people in the world I can&rsquo;t do anything. The same ear that opened itself up to the world to be encouraged and educated is the same ear that hears the accusations, the discouragement, the disappointment and it&rsquo;s the same ear that&rsquo;s attached to the eyes that see the bank balance, that see the emails, that see the comments on Facebook.</p>
<p>Can our senses get a one-way valve upgrade?</p>
<p>Perhaps I&rsquo;d be happier if I was never told I could do anything, then when something amazing happened I&rsquo;d be really surprised and excited, instead of expecting amazing all the time which leaves me discouraged?</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A few years ago I thought it would be great fun to start an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple Fan Page on Facebook<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I&rsquo;d been a MacBook owner for about 3 years and thought that my Mac was the best thing since my high school let us wear short socks instead of long socks on sports day.</p>
<p>The iPhone was out in the wild, we didn&rsquo;t have it in Australia yet, but a few friends had imported iPhones and were hacking them, the world was slowly becoming more and more awesome everyday. The iPod Touch was released and I bought one straight away. Honestly, me and Apple could of had babies and I would&rsquo;ve brought them up without child support payments if Apple left. I was in love.</p>
<p>Slowly things evolved, over time I spent a considerable amount of money on products and it seemed like the rest of the world was because the Facebook page I had started was growing ever so slowly.</p>
<p>I named it Alt+Shift+K, if you&rsquo;re on a Mac that will show the Apple Logo. I never promoted this page, but like a wildfire it grew and today it&rsquo;s 150,000 members strong. The Australian Liberal Party couldn&rsquo;t even get that many people to vote for Tony Abbott today but somehow that many people clicked and became fans.</p>
<p>Facebook got worried and made me change the name of the page to &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fans of Apple<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; and although it was not as cool as a name, the love of Apple products continued to grow.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing though, my rose coloured glasses expected that everyone who clicked &ldquo;Become a Fan&rdquo; was a &ldquo;glass-half-full&rdquo;, Apple loving, forward thinking, early adopting person like me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m completely and extraordinarily wrong on that note.</p>
<p>Although only 50-60 people will comment on an iPad related post at a time it seems like they represent the majority with their immaturity and stupidity.</p>
<p>I call them stupid because they are dedicated to offensively calling out the iPad as a device they&rsquo;d never buy, or use etc.</p>
<p>The reason this bothers me is this: I don&rsquo;t care if they buy an iPad or not. My distaste is with their general attitude and character. I&rsquo;m curious if they represent the greater population. Is the general population of the world that small minded that they can&rsquo;t see the forest through the trees? Does the general population write-off a product, person or idea without having actually experienced it for themselves? Do people honestly have that much emotion and insecurity built-up that they will unleash it on Facebook toward a product they have not used yet? Are hypocrites really gaining this much ground? Will hypocrites be the next superpower in the world?</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m trying to say is, Facebook &ldquo;Fans of Apple&rdquo; hate commenters, piss off.</p>
<p>To the Apple Fans, love you guys. I love hanging out with people of similar passions and you&rsquo;re it.</p>

			 <p>I believe that God exists and he&rsquo;s kind of like the kiwi fruit of the world - no-one knows how to handle him and when someone gives it a go others call him out on it for not doing it their way.</p>
<p>I believe that arrogance, hypocrisy and ignorance are greater wrongs than not capitalising the g in God or dropping a swear word on the fly.</p>
<p>In face I think cancer is scared that one day we&rsquo;ll have charities for arrogance and drop in centres for hypocrisy where you can be a hypocrite in a safe environment then go back into the world with a big smile on your face cause you&rsquo;ve had your fix.</p>
<p>I believe that love heals more wounds than time does and that money doesn&rsquo;t make the world go round, but people do - and it&rsquo;s up to us to define the currency we use, be it love, money or marshmallows.</p>
<p>I believe that the word Christian is stained and the word religion is tainted. Why do we even use words to hide our honest opinion?</p>
<p>I believe that truth is like charity, it starts at home, only then can it infect politics, churches, businesses and corporations.</p>
<p>I believe that God exists, that he&rsquo;s a genius, that he loves every single person ever and he doesn&rsquo;t take holidays.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I just conducted a curbside interview with a Google Street View photographer/driver. He declined a radio interview but he didn’t mind answering a few questions out the front of his motel and he let me take a few photos as well. I found him driving down Dempster Street in Esperance, West Australia, en route to his motel for the night and tomorrow he&rsquo;s off to Ravensthorpe and continuing West towards Perth.</p>
<p>Employment and recruitment company <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Adecco<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> won the contract to photograph Australia for Street View in the initial tender two years ago and they continue to run the operation on this second around Australia photography journey. They have hired 23 drivers in 23 cars to traverse Australian streets and collate the data which is sent to Google to translate into the Street View service we find on Google Maps and 3 of those drivers are covering West Australia.</p>
<p>The cameras this year are different to the previous round. The last set up was of 7 cameras plus one on top and each camera was about 2-3 inches in diameter.</p>
<p>The camera setup this year is different with larger cameras, 9 cameras covering 360 degrees horizontally and 1 camera on top plus this year the photography is accompanied by 3 lasers which are measuring the distance between the camera and the subject.</p>
<p>To take the photos the driver flicks a switch and starts driving. This driver said the biggest problem he faced was keeping the bugs off the camera lenses, although not a problem in Esperance he jokingly said the Nullabor was painful.

			 <p>It&rsquo;s been 8 hours since the existence of the iPad was confirmed. All the readings are stable, Planet Earth is still functioning as per normal and there have been no reported iPad related deaths or trauma.</p>
<p>Phew!</p>
<p>There has, however, been a loud roar of love, discontent, hate, whinge, love again and a little bit more hate. The iPad keynote was one of the most expected and most hyped keynotes of recent times. Whilst <a href="http://feed.podcastmachine.com/podcasts/3033/episodes/15961">talking to Renai LeMay</a>this morning <a href="http://feed.podcastmachine.com/podcasts/3033/episodes/15961">here&rsquo;s a link to our podcast</a> I mentioned I would&rsquo;ve rather had saved my iPad virginity for this morning than to have had it taken all those weeks earlier by rumour after rumour.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs always delivers a passionate plea for people to continue to love and support his offspring in these keynotes, a plea which I&rsquo;ve answered each ad every time for the last 5 years, I am an Apple fanboy. Unfortunately for me, other fanboys and my comrades at the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fans of Apple Facebook Page<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the iPad wasn&rsquo;t designed, nor will it be marketed, to us.</p>
<h2 id="my-prediction">My Prediction</h2>
<p>I predict that the iPad will be marketed to the members of our community that don&rsquo;t know where the &lsquo;any&rsquo; key is, those that don&rsquo;t know how to &rsquo;log on to 10.0.0.1 and reconfigure the router&rsquo;, the mothers and fathers that need to call their son if they want to send an email, the friends who want to be on Facebook but aren&rsquo;t sure why they need to keep their recovery discs.</p>
<p>The iPad has been billed as a giant iPod Touch or iPhone. It technically is, with some features that are made to fit the larger than iPod screen real estate. This isn&rsquo;t such a bad thing, the iPod Touch is something anyone in my family could pick up and start using once they figure out that you just use your fingers.</p>
<p>This is the end of driving to your grandpa&rsquo;s house to show him how to defrag his computer!</p>
<h2 id="why-ill-still-buy-one">Why I&rsquo;ll Still Buy One</h2>
<p>The iPad will become a member of my technological family soon enough because I&rsquo;ve always liked using a desktop, preferably a Mac Pro but my main computer now is a MacBook. It&rsquo;s great but lacking in speed and configurability, it&rsquo;s ultraportable, especially when it&rsquo;s paired with a Telstra NextG USB stick and that&rsquo;s a feature I love.</p>
<p>Some day in the future I&rsquo;d like to go back to a Mac Pro in the home office and carry an iPad 3G on me at most times.</p>
<h2 id="some-of-the-negatives">Some of the Negatives</h2>
<p>It would&rsquo;ve been great to have a USB plug so a 3G USB stick could be used, we&rsquo;re also unsure what a micro-SIM is and if any carrier in Australia use it.</p>
<p>As usual Australian carriers will not be generous with their data packages, especially our friends at Tel$tra. In this blogger&rsquo;s home town Tel$tra is the only option for a mobile carrier unless you can rent a house at the base of the Vodafone or Optus tower.</p>
<h2 id="60-days">60 Days</h2>
<p>As announced today we could expect to have on in our hands within 2 months, between now and then it will be refined and hopefully iron out some of the bugs and this blogger will be a happy man when the postman arrives on that fateful March morning!</p>

			 <p>My 14 year old sister just announced on Facebook that she has a boyfriend!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m scared, not for myself, but for him. I&rsquo;m unsure what silly things I could say to him. He&rsquo;s 16 and my protective nature over one of the most important women in my life could scar the boy. I might even scare him with idle threats, dropping lines about my gun license and how tough I could be if I was a ninja.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also scared for her. I&rsquo;ve not met many respectable young men. I hope and pray this guy&rsquo;s a good one.</p>
<p>This is the first time I&rsquo;ve had to deal with a boyfriend, my little brothers can protect themselves from fools (well they can do a good enough job without my help) but I really feel this deep need to fly to Queensland and stand by my sister as a boyfriend guard.</p>
<p>Crazy much? I can&rsquo;t imagine how I&rsquo;ll feel when I have my on daughter!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure you, like I, have read one or two blog posts, tweets or Facebook statuses about how everything is different now. Social media is x and y, the internet is this and that and you can be rich or will be poor or your job and/or company will not be the same tomorrow as it was ten years ago.</p>
<p>This is all true, but the delivery of this heart  breaking news is often given in a harsh, corporate language, preached to the masses from a proverbial pulpit and the information, as true as it may be, often lacks that personal and practical direction and encouragement that lessens the bruises left by the corporate bug that just swept you over.</p>
<p>Seth Godin&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->daily blog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> posts (which this blogger receives by email) are a rigid mix of the latter but his recent release &ldquo;Linchpin: Are You Indispensable&rdquo; will hold a place in my bookshelf and heart as the influence it&rsquo;s had on my personal direction is like no other.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not told me everything else I knew and it&rsquo;s not regurgitated from every other leadership, secular or Christian, motivational book that I&rsquo;ve felt so bored reading.</p>
<p>Seth has presented an opportunity for this blogger, and for yourself if you choose, to forget some lies and to learn some truths.</p>
<p>An excerpt out of the book, I love it&rsquo;s fast paced and easily digestible style:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Linchpin is a well written and easily read book, that drives the reader through and leaves you satisfied and encouraged, not with your apparent lack of insight into the world today, but with the platform presented before you that is laden with opportunity like the underneath of a Christmas tree on the morning of December 25th.</p>
<p>Seth Godin explains Linchpin best in his own words &ldquo;the reason I wrote Linchpin: If you want to change people, you must create enough leverage to encourage the change to happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I write to deconstruct my brain and even then it&rsquo;s not a clear representation of how my neurons are working. I write to just &ldquo;get it out&rdquo; because while &ldquo;it&rsquo;s&rdquo; in I can&rsquo;t sleep or hold normal conversations.

			 <p>Christian&rsquo;s are everywhere. They all look, smell, sound different. Some proclaim to be better, more humble, bigger, stronger, improved than other Christians. Some think that others are &ldquo;this and that&rdquo; and some others think &ldquo;this and that&rdquo; about others.</p>
<p>Then there are those people who aren&rsquo;t 100% Christian, but they aren&rsquo;t not Christian. Interesting lot they are, I&rsquo;ve never succeeded at doing anything in halves.</p>
<p>Finally there&rsquo;s those that aren&rsquo;t Christian. They&rsquo;re atheists or buddhists &hellip; or &lt;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->insert religion, faith, game, cult<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; here.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I could barely proclaim to be Christian. If you break the word down it means Christ like. I&rsquo;m not really. I&rsquo;m not catholic or anything else. In high school, when I had to fill out a form I would say I my religion was &ldquo;Uniting Church&rdquo; cause that&rsquo;s what Dad said once. I&rsquo;m not an atheist because I don&rsquo;t really know what they believe. I&rsquo;m not weird enough to be a member of a cult either.</p>
<p>So this is who I am. I&rsquo;m a 28 year old male, who read some of the bible about 7 years ago, then listened to a few other people talk about who God was.

I read a bit more into it, turned out that God was a number of things, including but not conclusive of: creator of everything, author of life, the beginning and the end of everything. From there on I wanted to learn more about who he was and is, it turns out that he is (once again including but not conclusive) a complete and utter genius, he&rsquo;s omnipresent which means he is everywhere at all times, he is love and he is loving - completely without any exceptions or maybes.</p>
<p>I could go on, but I found that the more I learned about God, the more he was kind of different than the general image that was painted up until now. God, and his church, and everything ever associated with him, was weird, freaky, odd and boring in my public perception, did I mention weirdoes? I remember meeting Jesus freaks in the car park of a shopping centre, they wore Jesus shirts and wanted me to come to their Jesus movie. I was kind enough to avoid them from then on.</p>
<p>I was curious why this relationship aspect of God that I was reading about had never really been touted before either. The general run of society told me that God existed, but mainly so we could blame stuff on him or scream his name during sex (kind of like using a cheat code in a game, hoping God would make it better?). As I read a little bit more about God it kind of sounded like there could be a possibility of some two-way conversation, and aside from that thing there was also a possibility that God could actually right now be interested and excited about what&rsquo;s happening in my life. He might even want to help, which was an intriguing development because I&rsquo;m not used to being helped.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But &hellip; at some point the community, the group, the clique, got different. Some people wanted me to be perfect, some wanted nothing to do with me, some people were wondering why everyone else didn&rsquo;t spend all their time focused on their little problems and some people didn&rsquo;t want to hang out. This is the natural evolution of a group, but the consensus is that Christians didn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>But what got weird is that some people in the group did one weird thing, they some how associated it with Jesus, then did it more. This is a very generalised statement over many people. But I felt odd because I didn&rsquo;t like to flout about how Christian I was, or to prove it by attending the most Christian events, or falling over to make sure people knew I was being prayed for. Some people though were very keen on proving how Christian they could be, which was weird for me because I wasn&rsquo;t very &ldquo;that kind of Christian&rdquo; at all.</p>
<p>I was kind of keen on just being Josh, Josh that was trying to get to know God. Josh that tried to read the bible but found it hard and persevered anyhow.</p>
<p>I struggled talking to God, I struggled to pray, because I saw other people pray and it sounded like they were worried God was stupid, which was an odd thing to worry about from my point of view. If anything, I thought God could not be stupid, he could be many other things, complacent maybe, or even just resource savvy (the reason you didn&rsquo;t have a new car yet is because I asked first, etc). Nuances aside I was almost certain God couldn&rsquo;t be stupid. I&rsquo;m kind of stupid, but when people talk to me like I&rsquo;m really stupid it gets me in a bad mood. Was God in a bad mood?</p>
<p>Luckily God doesn&rsquo;t have bad moods.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So today I&rsquo;m not too worried about what people think. Although when their expectations of me are really high it does get me down, I just move on and forget about it. Because they aren&rsquo;t going to be accountable for my life. I am. I know that God wants me to be more Christ-like, after all Christ had some really good ideas and methods, but I also know that it might not happen overnight.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I also design things, like web sites and brochures. My full time job is at Macquarie Southern Cross Media, I&rsquo;ve been lucky enough to host a breakfast radio show on Radiowest in Esperance. I&rsquo;m also a wedding celebrant, and I like to write as well. Sometimes I write well and sometimes it&rsquo;s all broken like this blog post is. I also love going to church with my friends because most of them are trying to figure out the same thing I&rsquo;m trying to figure it out, so we&rsquo;ll try and figure it out together.</p>
<p>Sorry if you wanted me to be less honest and more poetic, this is raw unedited Josh.</p>
<p>There probably could of been a better ending. If you have one, let me know and I&rsquo;ll put it in here and credit you for it, thanks.</p>

			 <p>Over the last two weeks of roadtripping I&rsquo;ve been brewing over many, many, blog posts, ideas (good and bad) and have resisted blogging many of them, so I&rsquo;ll wrap them all up into one post. Here&rsquo;s my list of things I learnt (and observations) from my 2 week roadtrip across West Australia.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m sitting in a backpackers hostel in Fremantle &hellip; contemplating about life the universe and everything. This is my, and your, New Years Eve 2009.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s strange that the things I long for most, good company, comfortable surrounds, enough money, the laptop battery that will never run out and maybe a girl who can massage my tired neck and tell me everything will be ok, are the things I&rsquo;ve moved away from (especially the laptop battery bit, I&rsquo;m at 14% and counting!)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also strange to reflect on a decade lived. I remember 10 years ago this night, 18 years old, having only reached the age of buying alcohol 23 days earlier I was hot property on New Years Eve. I had a company car and some great friends to hang out with. We had a few drinks, I wore &ldquo;Year 2000&rdquo; sunglasses (my eyes were in the middle 0&rsquo;s &hellip; so cool) and we got through the night without losing power or having bits and bytes eat up all of our interwebs and other electrical things. Jesus didn&rsquo;t come back and the world didn&rsquo;t end. It had all the symptoms of an anti-climax.</p>
<p>10 years on and I&rsquo;m living a completely different life, 4000km west of 10 years ago, working as a radio personality, totally different habits, skills, abilities and a lot of new friends.</p>
<p>What are we to make of a decade, is the next one going to be completely different or will hover-cars eventually be released? I think there is power in this phrase from Psalm 30 &ldquo;but joy comes in the morning&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve looked at this life ahead of me one day at a time, each morning a new one and each day ends with that new opportunity for joy to come in the next morning.</p>
<p>Decades are nice, but they still start with a morning. (1% battery and click publish!)</p>

<p>My Brilliant Life: 28 years on and lots has happened, let me bring you up to date. This short, abridged and possibly incorrect account of my period of my life serves three purposes. Firstly, to help me remember where I’ve been and be thankful for where I’m going, secondly to seek your input and editing if your memory is better than mine. Finally to document a life changed, a life that I didn&rsquo;t think was, but actually is brilliant, proof that who you were isn’t exactly who you will be and what you’ve done doesn’t have to drag you down but can build you up.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I&rsquo;m 16 and a half years old, having just got my drivers license learners permit in Queensland and I get myself a night in jail because I wasn&rsquo;t wearing a bike helmet!</p>
<p>You remember when you got yours, a drivers license expands your horizons, it&rsquo;s like installing wings on a bird, the teen can be set free to drive wherever he wants! Though the years before you get your full drivers license, before you are set free, you travel differently, in Central Queensland you ride a bike.</p>
<p>This fateful day I was riding my bike through town, Victoria Street actually, out the front of the Old Commonwealth Bank building and the Old Courthouse. As was the fashion in those days you never wore your bike helmet, you had it hanging from your handlebars so that if you crashed you&rsquo;d at least have safe handlebars. The law at the time had all bike riders wearing helmets. As admirable as the lawful cause was I still wonder why we need to legislate silly things that keep stupid people like myself alive. Whatever happened to survival of the fittest?</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;m riding casually and the Police lights and siren squeals and I halt in fear. I&rsquo;ve heard that sound before and wondered what I could have done to get in trouble this time. Luckily it&rsquo;s only a $30 fine for not wearing my bike helmet. I nod and agree with the policeman at all the right moments, take the paper fine and put my helmet on and I&rsquo;m on my way. There&rsquo;s a subtle difference to every other occasion before now where I&rsquo;ve gotten in trouble, big or small, with the police. This time I had a drivers license and even though I wasn&rsquo;t driving a car they took my drivers license number and all my details.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I was driving down Harbour Road towards the center of town before the Forgan Smith Bridge in Mackay and the Police sirens light up. In Mackay at the time it was common for the Police to do random checks of random cars, it wasn&rsquo;t personal, they&rsquo;d check for stolen items, drugs, alcohol etc and check your BAC and license. After a search and some checks they let us go and all was fine. I drove about 40 metres before the Police sirens came back on.</p>
<p>The Police Headquarters had gotten back to the Police who had searched me via Police radio and let them know there was a warrant for my arrest and I was to be brought in immediately.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The Police that night said I could pay then, alas I did not have $200 on me. My dad nor my boss would answer their phones, I had no money and no lifeline! So I spent the night in the watchhouse (local police mini-jail is proably a good description if you&rsquo;re unaware of what a watchhouse is). Nights in jail earn you money towards your fines, its remunerable repentance in a funny way, so I stayed two days, technically, because I came in before midnight and left the next morning. I&rsquo;d paid most of the fine off through my sleep and my dad came in the next morning and bailed me out, and all was fine once more, thanks Dad!</p>

It's pretty good (though the caramel latte could of received one extra stir of the spoon)&rdquo;]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[/caption]</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sitting in a cafe writing this blog post, in the extremely busy and especially nice town of Margaret River. It&rsquo;s the time of year that many tourists flood the town of 12,000 people and the local retailers are sure to benefit from the onslaught of visitors to the town.</p>
<p>The cafe is currently turning people away because their front door sign says they close at 4pm. I&rsquo;ve seen them knock back at least 20 people who would spend approximately $10 each, not mentioning those that didn&rsquo;t come in because it looked like it was closing.</p>
<p>My opinion is that if you would take hold of the opportunity and stay open until the customers stop, not when the sign says 4pm. Customers after that time may notice this and think of themselves as receiving special service and being served and buying what you want to buy, opposed to being knocked back, is an overly positive experience - a dark contrast to the disappointed faces I saw leaving the cafe in the last hour I&rsquo;ve been sitting here.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your opinion? What kind of business and culture does it create to run your business &ldquo;by the book&rdquo; everyday or do you think that a looser operation is not favourable?</p>
<p>All of the great things in my life have come when I&rsquo;ve read the book, closed the book, then gone out and done something crazy and opportunistic.</p>

			 <p>When I was first investigating the move to Esperance many months ago I looked at the different Esperance websites for tourists and visitors. There was a common statement being made: Esperance has no traffic lights and no McDonald&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Such a limiting and negative statement of identity. It lacks a positive affirmation of what Esperance is and who lives here. Esperance is a town of amazing people, physically isolated though they hold one another close. The community groups are active, the industry stakeholders are unified and the townsfolk live here because they love the town, although modern times allow us to move to the city easily the 15,000 residents are here by choice, Esperance loves Esperance.</p>
<p>But in this little sleepy hollow of love and goodwill, the local residents drive past the western end of Dempster Street in fear and loathing of a new building project being undertaken right next to the Bijou Theatre.</p>
<p>Esperance&rsquo;s identity is about to change as a McDonald&rsquo;s Family Restaurant is established on the corner of William Street and Dempster Street and although many people are singing a song of doom for local business and gloom for our eating habits, I&rsquo;m seeing a brighter future for Esperance which doesn&rsquo;t involve a Big Mac and fries.</p>
<p>McDonald&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t have to be the end of local fast food businesses, but it might be if local businesses believe the hype and fall on their sword. The professional edge that McDoanld&rsquo;s brings to town might actually be the encouragement our local business community needs to shape up and grow.</p>
<p>Ronald and friends run a smooth operations and the consistency they try to deliver is their strength. Worldwide you can walk into a McDonalds and have a consistent experience, if you&rsquo;ve ever been in one before then you&rsquo;re already familiar with the operations, you know there is a menu above the counter and the people behind the counter will take your money kindly. The architects and consultants design the premises to train you on how McDoanld&rsquo;s &lsquo;works&rsquo; as you enter the premises.</p>
<p>How can Esperance survive this city slicker? Here&rsquo;s a few of my hints:</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve decided upon a few things for 2010. After a pretty turbulent, active and amazing 2009 I wanted to up the ante for next year.</p>
<p>Donald Miller has weighed heavily upon these decisions - his recent release has pushed me out of the realm of comfortable and into a journey filled with stories of great feats. Although I attempted a great feat and failed yesterday (I tried to climb Frenchmans Peak - fear got the better of me) I&rsquo;m looking forward to trying more.</p>

<p>So how did all this happen and where has it taken me? Cale Hill is the man to blame for all this, he suggested I audition for &ldquo;A Christmas Carol&rdquo; at the Bijou Theater, my only previous experience with the Bijou was months earlier when I was investigating this little town called Esperance before I moved here and I found a news article about McDonald&rsquo;s wanting to open a restaurant in Esperance but the &rsquo;local theater&rsquo; was complaining about the noise that would come from it and possibly impede on a production there. I mocked them at the time &hellip; now I&rsquo;m &rsquo;them'.</p>

			 <p>Amazing stories are being told in many buildings across every town and city across the world on stages big and small this week. I’ll call it the local church, it’s my source of great stories and they really are great stories, but really, it&rsquo;s just your life, adapt as necessary.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Then I hear other people tell me their stories about hearing great stories. Often you’ll even hear the storytellers tell stories about storytellers who told stories to the storytellers at a storyteller’s conference.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden you realise … this is just a film festival … where all the best stories are told, then some more come in, and after many frozen Cokes and boxes of proverbial popcorn you find yourself still sitting in the cinema of life watching all these great stories yet your bum is slowly grooving itself into the seat like a crazy cat.</p>
<p>The film festival has its merits. The films are good, entertaining and very well made, usually inspired by actual events that were great in their own right. It’s also really good to get them in the one place; it’s rather convenient and doesn’t put you out too much.</p>
<p>It’s also nice to see the films with those you love and care for, friends, family, neighbours. You can talk about the films afterward in the café, even hold a little movie review club where you talk about all the good films and what they mean to you, you’d meet in someone’s house and have cake.</p>
<p>But somewhere along the way we strolled down the path of least resistance. Paying our way through the film festival, laughing at the right moments and then quoting the all right parts when with our friends so we can all laugh and cry together. It’s best that way.</p>
<p>After all … who would consider actually living a life worth telling a story about. That’s crazy talk, especially when you’re fully engaged in the film festival and the cinema tickets are going cheap.</p>
<p>It’s more than probable that no one else would be really supportive of the idea … after all they have really good movies for us to watch, with really entertaining stories. Maybe there’s no more room for good stories anymore?</p>
<p>I started out hoping to encourage you, or I, one of us at least, to go out and live a life of great risk, high adventure, great cost and extreme danger. A life that they would write about in the weekend newspaper magazine. The kind of life that a filmmaker might pick up one day and make a film about. But maybe that’s too much to hope for, considering there’s another film starting soon …</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The modern equivalent for a life partner, the humble yet powerful bar of chocolate has been given extra props today as it not only tastes amazing, is reasonably priced and fits easily into your bag but it’s now also been proven to reduce stress.</p>
<p>Indeed many people would claim the research redundant as they’ve been finishing bars of chocolate in an effort to calm down for years, at least now it’s scientifically proven.</p>
<p>Mice in the experiment were separated based on how happy they were, though I’m not sure how you measure a mouse’s happiness, the unhappy mice were fed a small amount of chocolate, unleashing the chemicals hidden deep within the dairy milk saviour.</p>
<p>Once the chocolate had been administered the mice were found to be de-stressed.</p>
<p>This week I was interviewing the managing director of an Australian chocolate company on my radio show who was sharing this marketing genius of research with me and I saw another news article, one regarding the syndrome sweeping Japan which I’ve dutifully dubbed MJ Fever.</p>
<p>MJ Fever is not a music obsession, sexual or illegal activity, dance move or jig. MJ Fever is that seemingly natural drive that pushes you away from who you really are.</p>
<p>Michael Jackson suffered it more than most; with his skin transformations and general slide from his teenage years away from everything he started out as and with to where we last saw him a few months ago.</p>
<p>I’m sure I think Michael Jackson suffered the most because his life was under the microscope more than most; there would be people who spend every last dollar in an attempt to not be who they are.</p>
<p>MJ Fever in Japan is sweeping the nation with white skin all the rage, where as in Australia we want tanned skin. Every country and every generation has it’s thing it wants to change.</p>
<p>Imagine the resources we’d have available to us if we could be happy with the us that’s here, free and available. Imagine the time, money, time … and the money … and the time …. life would be grand, or maybe we could just eat more chocolate.</p>

			 <p>Virgin Blue, the airline that made flying fun and accessible all those years ago made a big boo boo today.</p>
<p>At 2:45pm (Friday, 13th November 2009) West Australia time an email was received by many Australian&rsquo;s, possibly thousands, notifying them of a surprise in regard to their Velocity membership, here&rsquo;s the email I received:
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Since that email was received social networks and forum board lit up across Australia, this was a very generous offer but some thought it was needed, in a competitive air travel market Virgin Blue had figured out how to gain everyone&rsquo;s loyalty!</p>
<p>The Velocity Gold Card requires you to earn 50,000 points each year to keep the card. You can earn points with Virgin Blue Velocity partners but the main way to earn them is by flying Virgin Blue at 5 points per $1 spent - $10,000 a year on flights.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m almost certain I&rsquo;m not spending $10,000 on flights this year &hellip; but I&rsquo;m up for the challenge! And I think many Australian&rsquo;s were as well.</p>
<p>At 4:25pm (Friday, 13th Nov &lsquo;09) Virgin Blue corrected what we found out was a mistake:
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now we all watch with interest as Virgin Blue manages this PR nightmare. Thousands of Australian&rsquo;s have been offered something they don&rsquo;t deserve &hellip; and we want to keep it!</p>
<p>Well I do &hellip; how about you?</p>

			 <p>A good friend of mine, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stu Larsen<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, penned a song called &ldquo;The Black Tree&rdquo; on the EP with the same name and released it earlier this year.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Listening to the EP, especially this song, on a high volume holds a special sort of power in bringing peace, it just levels you out, makes you feel better.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure why some days you wake up and feel poor in spirit. Radio personalities have this divine calling to push aside their feelings and personal situations in order to entertain and keep company with listeners. It&rsquo;s why I love my work, I get this secret access to people&rsquo;s lives, in their car, office, bedroom. When you&rsquo;ve got this special access it&rsquo;s like meeting the Queen, you&rsquo;re now with the Queen and this is her party, not yours.</p>
<p>So today I just feel poor in spirit and I&rsquo;m not allowed to acknowledge it. I&rsquo;m physically ok, healthy enough. I&rsquo;ve got food in my pantry, stomach and access to more if needed at Woolworths. There&rsquo;s a large collectoin of people across this earth who think somewhat positive thoughts of me, though I&rsquo;m unsure how many are in Esperance. My faith in God is steadfast and my mental health is at a seemingly normal level.</p>
<p>Perhaps I uncovered something when I was unsure how many of those people were in Esperance. Love is something that cannot be assumed (example: stalkers), love is something that needs to be communicated on an ongoing basis. As is that sticking point in most blogs where you&rsquo;ve lost the first 85% of the readers, you&rsquo;ve stuck  this far, so I&rsquo;ll proclaim I love you, it&rsquo;s a response to your reading ability this far in, ok?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For a moment though think about the question you&rsquo;re asking though. As far as questions go, when you&rsquo;re hoping for an answer, that&rsquo;s a poor question.</p>
<p>Perhaps next time you see someone and you feel a caring or worried feeling towards them perhaps speak more about their situation, so you might actually be able to help, for example:</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Somehow I ended up on the Australian Idol website today and found it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Inside Idol&rdquo; section where kids can ask questions of their celebrity idols and others involved in the show.</p>
<p>One kid had asked a question of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Andrew G<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;How did you get into the business, where did it start and how did you end up as a host? What did you first do to get you into hosting on television?&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Andrew had a good and simple answer: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Radio. Get into radio and learn about broadcasting, then buy yourself a video camera and practice!&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Someone replied: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;i want to do radio , but i guess it takes a very long time to get yourself out there and only fery few are very successful&rdquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I read this and had one of those &ldquo;feeling sad for the youth of today&rdquo; moments I&rsquo;m sure my grandpa experiences every time he takes a breath. I&rsquo;m kind of on this theme at the moment of being sick of seeing other people live their dreams, hearing the stories, talking about it amongst friends and preaching about it at church, in magazines &amp; on Tv, but no-one does it.</p>
<p>So I replied: If anything doesn&rsquo;t take hard work or a good measure of time then it&rsquo;s not worth doing kid. Hard work builds a character in you that you can&rsquo;t buy in Myers or learn about in a magazine. Andrew didn&rsquo;t just wake up and be a radio host any less than he woke up and was hosting Aussie Idol.</p>
<p>After 7 years of working really hard - volunteering for years, working jobs I didn&rsquo;t really want to - I now have a job in commercial radio doing the breakfast radio show in regional WA - 3000km from my friends and family. It&rsquo;s just another step in the journey if that&rsquo;s what you want to do.</p>
<p>Stop hearing about other people living their dreams and start telling your own story about how you&rsquo;re living yours. Once day soon you&rsquo;ll look back and freak out at how far you&rsquo;ve come.</p>

<p>Pauly, Mikey and the Sandman were the breakfast crew at the time, I&rsquo;d wake up just in time to hear the Sandman deliver his daily radio soap and would listen through until I had to sprint outside to catch the school bus.</p>
<p>Although I was fascinated by it I never even fantasised that I could work in the industry, let alone be the voice that I found so friendly and hilarious. Getting past the age of 21 seemed like a big enough goal at the time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d never quote this as a problem brought upon me or the fruit of a particular conversation or situation, but the idea of life past 21 never seemed a reality to me as a child, even as a teenager. There was this sense of undoing that would occur at 21, by 22 I&rsquo;d either passed away or taken on a vegetative state. I simply had no vision for my life past 21. In my teenage years my relationships with my parents disintegrated to a point where my father dropped me off at a homeless youth shelter, he had also bailed me out of the Police watch-house as well, amongst a truckload of failures that I brought upon myself from the ages of 15 to 21.</p>
<p>Throughout this journey of finding out exactly what the law was and what happened when you broke it I always maintained a fascination with the broadcast medium we call radio.</p>
<p>There were a range of characters that continued to entertain me, sound like they were my friend when I was alone at home or in the car and of course keeping me informed and enjoying music. I was the perfect listener.</p>
<p>People like the Big Kahuna on Sea FM Nights, Paul and Suki and then Moyra on Sea FM breakfast on the Gold Coast, Keiron Atkinson on Sea/Gold Gold Coast, Meech and Teegs on Hot FM Mackay then just Meech on 4MK, Pricey at 4TO Townsville, Stan at 4CRM Mackay, the old 4MK and Hot FM crew in Mackay in the 90&rsquo;s and then the legends at Sea FM in Mackay since it&rsquo;s inception and especially Greg Clark and of course anyone who&rsquo;s ever worked at Triple J. These were my idols.</p>
<p>Idols or not though, I was still a pot smoking, alcoholic, mostly useless kid.</p>
<p>A few months after turning 21, in the hot lonely summer of 2002 on the Gold Coast I eventually sucked dry any friend or resource I had on the Gold Coast, packed my bags and went home to Mackay. I&rsquo;m forever grateful to Andrew Evans, my Dad and at that time his new wife Judy and those few people in Mackay who helped me out, I&rsquo;ll never forget some of the favours lavished upon me then.</p>
<p>At the same time I met a girl who&rsquo;s mother told me it would be a good idea to go to church that Sunday &hellip; or else! Luckily I found something special that went beyond Lyn, the mother, it was like that moment in the Sixth Sense when you find out that (I won&rsquo;t ruin it for those who haven&rsquo;t seen it) and then the whole movie makes sense. That was what happened at Mackay Christian Family over the course of about a year and a half. While I&rsquo;m in the thankful mood I can&rsquo;t forget at all Ben Naitoko, Tim Spark, Cam Murison, Ben Ives, Adam Lloyd-Jones, Tuppy, Kat Mac, Josh Murray, the family that is MCF and Rob Booth-Jones and his wife Denise and daughter JBJ.</p>
<p>That experience unlocked something within me that no other person or experience has done, it gave me purpose and a vision to fulfill the dreams that lingered in my inner most being.Mostly these formed the basis of depression and disappointment, much like a child standing in a candy store without a cent to his name. But now I was a kid in the candy store of life with a blank cheque.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I still can&rsquo;t remember who I met on that fateful day apart from Stan Hillard who offered me an opportunity to learn how to announce on radio. That day the radio transmitter was dead and being repaired so he took me into the studio and let me play around and play songs whilst we were off air.</p>
<p>I was enjoying myself to no end, 4CRM had a music library bigger than anyone else I knew, all on CD, not a computer or automation system in sight. In the studio was a quaint little Elan Broadcast Console, 2 CD players, 2 mini disc players, a vinyl deck and tape player with three microphones on their respective stands.</p>
<p>The fear of God came over me though as Stan entered the studio and made me aware of the transmitter being fixed and I was now live on the air. He hurriedly instructed me to continue playing songs like I had been and to await further instruction.</p>
<p>From that humble beginning Stan and others around the station taught me everything I know today. It was a fantastic training base, especially learning how to broadcast without the aid of an automation system like I have today.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Within a few months a position&rsquo;s vacant position appeared for a &ldquo;Broadcast Systems Engineer&rdquo; for RG Capital Radio. I read the word Broadcast and applied instantly not knowing what the job entailed or if I could do it. Within a few weeks Brian, the Station Engineer from Rockhampton was showing me the ropes and I was bluffing my way through as much of it as I can, yet trying to recognise what would kill me and what wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Through some kind of miracle, after about 6 months of radio fun in Mackay, the IT Manager of the RG Capital Radio Group, which had just transformed into a much larger group, the Macquaire Regional Radioworks, had his eye on me and asked me to move to the Gold Coast office to take on a lead support role in the IT Department, as honoured as I was it took about 3 weeks of arguing with myself, God, my friends and the IT Manager, Pete Schmidt, to get me to move. On November 23rd I arrived at the Gold Coast, after a 2 week contract in Walgett in Western NSW helping an Aboriginal radio station setup an automation system.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I learnt so much about IT from Pete, Engineering became a mystical art thanks to Jim and Paul and the neccasary evil of distribution of the day&rsquo;s events was a theatre show to no end thanks to the Bartman and after him Hendo.</p>
<p>Yet &hellip; each day I came to work I didn&rsquo;t sit in front of a microphone, now I didn&rsquo;t do a lot of IT either. That&rsquo;s pretty much thanks to Carl, Regan, the News team, AJ and whoever was on air at Sea FM (thanks Ken and Dan).</p>
<p>So after a little over a year I realised I needed to kick myself into action and I resigned, to go to a Ministry College.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That humble start led me a on an illustrious career of learning how to do most things in the church, plu things I&rsquo;d never would&rsquo;ve thought of. I learnt how to mix sound for a live band and do it well. Graphic design, communication, marketing and working in a team are just some of the skills that got sharpened in SURFCiTY. Although I sunk myself to deep into the mold, and often was hurt because of this peculiar placement, it was a valuable and fruitful deployment and I&rsquo;m eternally thankful to the whole team of staff especially Lucas, Kent, Dave and Rosanna, Mark, Shamiso, Kate, Amanda, Wendy and Jeremiah, Chrissy and the Pastors Richard and Erica plus so many other individuals I served, served with and was served by.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve slowly moved through the years and now, mid way through 2009 and I&rsquo;m 27 starting to wonder if being on staff at a church meant I was going to be a cynical grumpy old man sometime soon.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>On arrival at the Gold Coast I had emailed Callum (and I&rsquo;ve never stopped) the program director, announcing my arrival and my humble amazingness, perhaps he could give me a prime time show or something of that sort.</p>
<p>Callum, Simon, Phil, Hayden, Noelene and Rob, over the years at 1073, have generously heaped opportunity after opportunity upon me and I&rsquo;m the better for it. Callum gave me a night here and there on the night time show, then I filled in where I could, attempting to learn music programming, scheduling, production and whatever else came up. Eventually one morning came where Callum couldn&rsquo;t do the brekky show and I was asked to fill in.</p>
<p>From that one day &lsquo;filling in&rsquo; I stayed there for 9 months until the no or low pay sent me crazy and I left the position, wondering why on earth I&rsquo;d surrendered the throne I was so desperate to sit in. Luckily there were still some weekend shifts I could fill and generally annoy Callum at every given moment.</p>
<p>Out of that experience I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to fail dismally on air in a major market, learn how to recover and I&rsquo;ve made some amazing friends along the way, notably Cal, Michelle, Deano and Ash.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I put in an application and an aircheck, my aircheck was pretty bad and highly produced so I was asked to record a better aircheck understandably. The only problem was my voice was gone thanks to laryngitis. After emails, phone calls, more airchecks, begging and pleading, I accepted the offer to take the breakfast show on RadioWest in Esperance on 747 AM and this is where I stand today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an opportunity like no other and every day I learn so much, my brain gets contorted, twisted and shoved back into place upside down and generally each day ends quickly at around 8pm, tonight it&rsquo;ll be 9:30pm, and I&rsquo;m left wondering why on earth am I in Esperance, how on earth did I get here and where the heck am I going next.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The sick and strange thing is this. Living your dream often comes at a price you can&rsquo;t afford and it brings a situation you didn&rsquo;t anticipate.</p>
<p>For me the cost was losing the daily presence of so many special people in my life. I know we&rsquo;re all still friends. Facebook, Twitter, Email, Flickr and phone calls all serve there purpose but I miss everyone so much. The situation I didn&rsquo;t anticipate is the reality I&rsquo;m living today, it&rsquo;s strange and for every day that I wonder in the glory that is living a this life there is another day where you sit here all alone in the middle of my dream and say &ldquo;what the f#$k have I done&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>Here&rsquo;s the iPhone Apps and why I love them.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bible<!-- raw HTML omitted --> - lifechurch.tv hav made a great program for reading the bible, it uses YouVersion and can store a few offline translations.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pkt Weather<!-- raw HTML omitted --> - this has much better info than the standard iPhone weather app .. which is handy if you&rsquo;re doing an outside broadcast or if the studio internet is out!</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tweetie<!-- raw HTML omitted --> - my Twitter client of choice, it&rsquo;s bigger brother (2.0) will be even better. I am a rather unhappy with the level of customer service to come out of the developers for this app, but it&rsquo;s still my favourite.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ping<!-- raw HTML omitted --> - it&rsquo;s like free SMS&rsquo;ing between iPhones!</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Facebook<!-- raw HTML omitted --> - i&rsquo;m a facebooker</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->NetNewsWire<!-- raw HTML omitted --> - it&rsquo;s a pretty good RSS reader - which in English: it&rsquo;s good for reading news online using Google Reader feeds.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll also notice on the front page all of my main apps, I use these apps daily, or if not daily I want quick access to them.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This second page is where I have all my secondary apps and photography apps.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Autostitch<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is the best Panorama creating app I&rsquo;ve found but it would be nice if it worked like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pano<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &hellip; but not with Pano&rsquo;s low quality stitching of photos.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Photogene<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a basic photo editor, cropper etc.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cameraflash<!-- raw HTML omitted --> brightens photos but not well</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Genius<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a camera app with two additions I like, 10 second timed shot and sound activated shot.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->CameraBag, OldBooth, CinemaFX and Coloursplash<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are fun little photo apps that include filters etc.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Flickr<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a the free Flickr brand iPhone App - good for uploading etc. Could be better though, i.e. blog posting of Flickr pics within the app!</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Aardvark<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a free app for the Aardvark social question answering network. It&rsquo;s kind of fun and uses Push notify.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->tvGuide<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a great TV Guide app, although it fails at WA timing for Foxtel shows</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->iTalk Lite<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is just like Voice Recorder, but it makes up for the iPhone Voice Recorder app in allowing Wi-Fi transfers of audio.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Clock Gt<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a free Clock App which comes in handy in Outside Broadcasts for timing out.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sketchbook<!-- raw HTML omitted --> looks fun anduseful in an arty sense but I&rsquo;ve not really used it yet.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Goodreader<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is for reading all my PDF ebooks.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The winners on this page is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wikipanion<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which is surprsingly better than the in-house <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wikipedia<!-- raw HTML omitted --> app.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Roar<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a great Australian sports news app.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Aussie Rules Live<!-- raw HTML omitted --> helps you keep up-to-date with &ldquo;the other code&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Radio Flare<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a new, cool and currently free game!</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->HeyWay<!-- raw HTML omitted --> stands for Hey, Where Are You and it uses 3rd Party Notification - pretty cool.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->iTranslate<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a free language translator.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Grill Guide<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a BBQ helper!</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ping.fm<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Moby<!-- raw HTML omitted --> used to be needed but they&rsquo;ve been made redundant of late.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Weird News<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a radio announcers friend, show prep in a box!</p>
<p>.. they&rsquo;re the main apps I use &hellip; the other stand outs are the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I Am T-Pain<!-- raw HTML omitted --> App which is a new source of hilarity in my world, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ragdoll blaster<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was fun until I finished it. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Boxca<!-- raw HTML omitted -->r is my Push Notification agent of choice for Facebook and Twitter. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lightsaber<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is still fun and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tris<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is good although no longer available. Finally <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ocarina<!-- raw HTML omitted -->,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> iDrum <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FlightControl<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are old favourites.</p>
<p>Not many of those Apps are free, but like they say, you get what you pay for.</p>

			 <p>In recent travels it&rsquo;s been made known to me that the next big thing after sliced bread and the colour &lsquo;black&rsquo; is this internet thing we&rsquo;re all keen about at the moment. The music industry has been shaken to the very core of recent times with blame being laid firmly on those pesky mp3&rsquo;s and Apple Computer&rsquo;s but it seems not all is bad in the world of 1&rsquo;s and 0&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_311&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;565&rdquo; caption=&ldquo;We Are Hunted&rdquo;]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[/caption]</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We Are Hunted<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a collaborative effort between <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Native Digital<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wotnews<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that draws on the people power that is social networking and blogs to create a chart of the hottest 99 tracks in the world today. The technology behind the site is the same technology used to aggregate the news on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wotnews.com.au<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I threw an email their way with a few questions attached about how the chart was run and where it was going and this is how it all went down.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->JW:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> What has been the driving force behind your team&rsquo;s development of wearehunted.com?
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->WAH:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> We are huge music fans and consume music online, each in different ways.  We had a mix of skills and decided to put together an essential online music property - something we wanted to visit every day.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->JW:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The website states the chart is driven by sentiment, expression and advocacy. Would you explain that on a more human and practical level. Is there an emotions engine that measures how many times a song title has the word &ldquo;omg&rdquo; next to it or do real people scour real blogs and websites?
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->WAH: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The engine is automated.  Our analysis includes sentiment detection to work out whether people like or dislike a track.  Semantics to understand who people are talking about. Clustering and classification to group related artists and their noise. And network analysis to uncover the connections between artists and the people who write about them.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->JW: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Do industry sources, for good or for evil, have any impact on the chart? (i.e. Record labels, distributors or artists)
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->WAH:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> None whatsoever.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->JW:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Today on the chart there are remixes of current popular songs, mainstream popular music and a good portion are independent or emerging artists. There has even been some older popular songs come back into the chart. How would you say this reflects the community who influence the chart.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->WAH:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I think there is definitely a diversity of music tastes out there.  Even within our team there&rsquo;s a love for everything from commercial to rare DnB.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->JW:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Traditional charts have been geographically based and also split up into genres along with a mainstream chart. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->We Are Hunted<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has been billed as the chart for the people but the people still live in different cultures and have different music tastes, how will wearehunted.com reflect this diversity?
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->WAH:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> We Are Hunted will reflect the aggregate of all these people&rsquo;s online musical activity.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->JW:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> What vision have you got for the chart into the next 6 months and the next 1-3 years?
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->WAH:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> First and foremost we want the site to be an essential destination for its users.  We access and analyse extraordinary amounts of data and we intend to work with companies to help them know and understand what we know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of what is happening in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->We Are Hunted<!-- raw HTML omitted --> camp, it&rsquo;s a website you can set to be your homepage because every day it&rsquo;s a new chart. As a web application it runs very nicely and smoothly, you can click on a song and listen to it, although some of the audio is sometimes missing or a very different mix to the radio release or even album release.</p>
<p>The music you&rsquo;ll find on there is very diverse, mainstream through to indie and everywhere in between. Typically it is music that demographically is appreciated by the 18-30 year old age bracket because they are the people that are typically blogging or tweeting about the music they&rsquo;re loving, but that&rsquo;s alright by me because I&rsquo;m 27 and loving the music on the chart.</p>

			 <p>For simplicity I&rsquo;ll break this up into a few sections, namely: The Flight Home, The Rescue/Stimulus Package, The Rescue Package for the Rescue/Stimulus Package.</p>
<p>My flight home was fine but Brandon could not take me home so it ended up in an adventure, read on for more.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After I landed I quickly called Brandon my housemate who was going to take me home as he works in Brisbane, but he got distracted by his Sunshine Coast bound girlfriend and would not be driving south tonight. Girlfriends are cool &hellip; and distracting lol.</p>
<p>I had $5 to my name after a big weekend in Townsville and got a little worried about how I might get home. I considered jumping the train but got all convicted about breaking the law.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Ash and I are both exhausted and hungry at this point, food and home is on our minds as we go through the toll booth with my remaining pocket change completing the transaction.</p>
<p>The toll booth is still in the rear mirror as the engine makes the sounds no man wants to hear on a 100 km/hr motorway with no side roads or any room to pull over  on either side of the road. The fuel tank is empty.</p>
<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_236&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;300&rdquo; caption=&ldquo;Empty Tank Light - Don't Ignore it Boys&rdquo;]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[/caption]</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>At around 30km/hr I jump out of the passenger seat and run to the back of the car to start pushing it uphill while it still has momentum. The storm has not completely passed by this point, the raining is falling heavily and cars and trucks are speeding past frightening the life out of me. Thankfully Ash was already in the left hand lane out of at least three lanes. We push the car under the Lytton Road bypass and the Port of Brisbane Motorway onramp to the Gateway is a few hundred meters ahead of us. [<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google Map<!-- raw HTML omitted -->].</p>
<p>My brain spends the whole time trying to figure out how I could get out of doing this, which thankfully kept it distracted from the onslaught of traffic which I was certain would be the end of us.</p>
<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_237&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;480&rdquo; caption=&ldquo;We found refuge under the Port of Brisbane Motorway onramp to the Gateway Motorway&rdquo;]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[/caption]</p>
<p>Ash successfully parks the car in a moderately safe zone and also proves he is a scout at heart. He had a fuel tin in the boot ready for an occasion just like this.</p>
<p>So we get out Google Maps on the iPhone and find the nearest service station is apparently only 500m away (it turns out to be about 2km on the offramp to Wyndham).</p>
<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_238&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;384&rdquo; caption=&ldquo;The walk to Wyndham Shell Service Station&rdquo;]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[/caption]</p>

<p>Ash and I discussed what we could learn from this &hellip;. at first we thought God might want to bless everyone driving on the Motorway with a good laugh for the night or maybe he was going to put us into some weird yet wonderful situation where we could shine and be awesome!</p>

<p>But we soon found there were lessons of trust to be learnt, to not trust in our money, our experiences or other housemates but to trust in God and God only, not even Google or Michelle Poulsen (ed: haha) &hellip;. we saw an ambulance along the way and we realised we weren&rsquo;t really that poor or suffering, others were worse off than us tonight. Our leather shoes were well shaped to our feet now, the clothes we were wearing were cleaner &hellip; plus Ash and I have a better heterosexual relationship now.</p>

There you go Indian Shell boy &hellip; never lose your reward! .. oh, thank you!&rdquo;]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[/caption]</p>
<p>Good thing the rain stopped as we got back towards the car &hellip;. would&rsquo;ve hated to have gotten wet then &hellip;..</p>
<p>Ash proves once more that he is ready for any fuel disaster by showing off his fancy funnel and coke bottle contraption.</p>
<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_242&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;300&rdquo; caption=&ldquo;Fancy fuel thingy&rdquo;]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[/caption]</p>

<p>God is a bit of an expert at making good things out of crap things. By 10pm Ash and I were home, dry, with some home made Ash Punch special Spaghetti Bolegnaise and a DVD spinning in the Playstation 2.</p>
<p>What did we learn &hellip;. heaps &hellip;. but most of all &hellip;. quit worrying and trust in God. It&rsquo;s an age old message that gets thrown around like fat on a butcher shop floor, but it is the truth, it is a principle to living life on earth. Anything else that challenges that statement falls over everytime. Trusting in God is not a fancy saying that goes in books or on the bumper stickers on cars, but it&rsquo;s an ever present eternal truth.</p>

<p>Amongst a team of volunteer&rsquo;s in the tech/media/audio/visual/digerati department of the church, there are many valuable skills. The most prized possession is usually a set of ears to do an amazing sound mix, some people value the highly sought after talent of video editing MTV style. As much as these talents are sought after highly, I have different priorities.</p>
<p>I know in my church, in my department there is only one talent I prize above all others, dare I say many churches and perhaps even yours would be very similar.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Arriving <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(on time or early is preferable)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>A video editing extraordinaire once offered his honed skills to me to serve in my church, we were going to do amazing things, yet never turned up. A certain sound engineer had the ears of an angel but was unable to be at anything when required. I&rsquo;ve met many passionate people in my time serving at SURFCiTY Church but only only some of them have arrived, stayed, served and built the kingdom.</p>
<p>The only talent you can impress me with now after 6 years in the ministry is your ability to arrive (on time or early is preferable). Second to that is your ability to stay until the end, thirdly your ability to do what is asked of you.</p>
<p>Your university degree, or experience at another church and the hours you&rsquo;ve spent reading manuals and training books means <!-- raw HTML omitted -->diddly squat<!-- raw HTML omitted --> when you&rsquo;re not in a place where God can use it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my story at church, encouragment is thrown my way quite often, congregants think my videos are stunning, or that sound mix was delictable and my servanthood will surely be earning me treasures in heaven. My reply to them is that I am probably the least skilled, most unable person to be doing my job, but my team and self are the only ones arriving at 7:30am Sunday at the moment. My prayer is that others would arrive around me, replace me and do greater things than me, simply by arriving.</p>

			 <p>Seth Godin always packs a punch in his/blog, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->today is no different<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Below is his suggestion for how you could spend the American National Day of Service. Now I know that a large majority of my readers are not American and Martin Luther King is not someone we annually celebrate, but you can&rsquo;t take away the importance of a day of giving instead of receiveing. Maybe your national day of service could be today?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If every person in the US spent an hour doing something selfless, useful and leveraged, what would happen? What if you and your circle committed to doing it an hour a day for a year? 300 million hours is a lot of hours for just one day, a year of that would change everything.</p>
<p>While I applaud stopgap contributions like helping out in a soup kitchen (where labor and supplies are really needed), I wonder how those that are lucky enough to be web savvy can create work that really adds leverage. What if you did one of these things every day?</p>
<p>Here are some ideas that you can do online or in your community, with time, not so much with money.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple Inc. had an opportunity to go to the next level today, and before I sound to negative, I&rsquo;ll give them another chance soon, but for today, they&rsquo;ve missed out on a byte of the apple.</p>
<p>The Macworld expo has been a catalyst event for many years, it&rsquo;s drawn many people to the kingdom of Apple, myself and Kent being two people wooed by a Macworld keynote. Apple recently announced this year&rsquo;s Macworld would be their last, so I had high expectations of Steve and crew going out with a bang.</p>
<p>Today all we got was a fizzle:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now I&rsquo;m personally of the train of thought that Apple, and other companies can release what they want, when they want, and we are of our own free will to like or dislike, purchase or not purchase and to use or not use, so Apple&rsquo;s lack of announcement today is to their loss really and I&rsquo;m not losing sleep over it.</p>
<p>It is just interesting to see even the biggest trains grind to a halt simply because other trains are and less people are riding them. Apple&rsquo;s philosophy has always been to keep on taking things to new levels, bigger, better, stronger, tomorrow, faster and newer.</p>
<p>Today we got a few software upgrades and Colbie Caillat teaching us how to play guitar &hellip;&hellip; yay!</p>

			 <p>In regards to the protest against the Islamic school, a few questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What is the reason for the protest?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the reason for the protest is an Australian culture one, please remember how many Christians were on this island 230 years ago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is a biblical reason please state how it overrides going into all the world to make disciples, and loving our neighbour as we do ourselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What precedent do you hope to set if a ruling is made against a school run by people of faith?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have you thoroughly researched scripture, law and culture before you go out representing my God on Monday?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have you considered the ill effects a protest in Jesus name could do to the greater body of Christ on the Gold Coast? (The effect being that the only time the community hears from us is when we don&rsquo;t like something or someone)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why would you bring an Australian flag to the protest? The Kingdom of God is home to people of all all flags, all cultures, all skin colours, all sexes and all different pasts. The unity is in our redemption, not which flag we hold true to.</p>

			 <p>Seth Godin (Google &lsquo;Seth&rsquo; for his Blog) spoke recently about Cadillac dealers and other human beings, and how people are people too, and you need to respect that. If it&rsquo;s important to a Cadillac dealer, or if &ldquo;it&rsquo;s&rdquo; important to you, then it actually is important.</p>
<p>Talking about this new recognition of importance in someone&rsquo;s life, he says that faith is different to religion, faith is something that everyone has, everyone has faith in something or someone, the difference with religion is that it amplifies someone&rsquo;s faith, it supports the faith.</p>
<p>The problem with religion is that it maintains status quo, and it becomes unchallengeable.</p>
<p>Where I&rsquo;m actually going with this is that Seth has recognised his calling, to be an agent of change in faith, not religion, and that everyone has a faith, and that faith they have; is important - to them - and YOU need to respect that.</p>
<p>Why? No-one has ever made friends and influenced people without a small measure of respect at the beginning of the relationship; and perhaps even a bit more respect continuing on into the relationship.</p>
<p>Faith changes often, but for you to be a part of that you might want to recognise that faith already exists and you need to respect that straight up.</p>

<p>In today&rsquo;s paper Mayor Clarke admits he has trouble finding a carpark so he parks illegally. Before we even talk Rapid Transit System or his refusal to acknowledge the growth of the city, and it&rsquo;s current needs stemming from that growth and it&rsquo;s current trajectory, the Mayor cannot find a carpark.</p>
<p>I love the fact he doesn&rsquo;t have a driver, and he drives a Prius but I especially love that he can&rsquo;t find a car park, because it&rsquo;s a situation that I&rsquo;ve been in more than once. The difference being in my situation is that I won&rsquo;t pay $35 for a good park and I&rsquo;m not good mates with the parking inspectors.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good that we find out our Mayor is just as human as us and just as troubled by our City&rsquo;s woes as we are, if only he would now act on it.</p>

			 <p>I just wanted to spread some positive and truthful information in light of recent news that Australians have lost at least $36 million dollars to internet money scams.</p>
<p>Without ruling out the divine hand of God bringing finance into a situation, here are some guidelines for receiving money via email or internet.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you receive and email offering you/blessing you/giving you money it is a scam.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;ve never met the person it is a scam.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --> - If you have never heard of the price/princess/king/queen/<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Instead of forwarding on the emails about false viruses and other rubbish, please forward this on to people you care about. Because as you can read in the below news article released today, people are getting ripped off everyday, please don&rsquo;t let you be that person.</p>
<p>And if you do want to be ripped off or depart with thousands of dollars from your bank account, rather than give it to a Nigerian scammer, mail it to SURFCiTY Church instead, we&rsquo;ll put it to much better use in Surfers Paradise doing what God has called us to do.</p>

			 <p>Ben Harper sings on his latest album, in the song &ldquo;Fight Outta You&rdquo;: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather find out who you are, than who you&rsquo;re not&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I found out who Dale was, Barney was and who I was on Sunday morning about 1am as we left Three Beans Cafe in Broadbeach to go back to our cars parked at the rear of the National Australia Bank. We walked past the Barcode Nightclub and were set up by some Native NZ boys.</p>
<p>One very large bloke set us up, then two others jumped the three of us. They punched Barney in the jaw, and then the two proceeded to Dale and myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what went through the other two minds, but for myself it played out like this:
a) You can talk yourself out of this
b) Do I scream at them all tellign them to stop in the name of Jesus
c) God &hellip;. what would Jesus do in this situation
d) Far out he punched me
e) I can tackle him real easy
f) Turn the other cheek???
g) Punched again a few times (2-3 I think)</p>
<p>As the maori boys ran off I jumped in my car and encouraged the other boys to do the same. I sped off down Albert St onto Surf Parade and saw the girls walking back with Zay. Making a quick phone call to Katie to make sure she left asap I arranged with Dale and Barney to meet them at Gold Coast Hospital where we were checked out, I was fine with a black eye, Dale was fine and Barney had a broken jaw.</p>
<p>Jumping forward to today, two days on, after banter, photos, laughs and alot of thought I was asked about the incident once more and the onversation was rather simple.</p>
<p>Was there heaps of them? No, only two
Were they bigger than you? No
Were they stronger than you? No
Were they better fighters than you? No
I guess you just locked up? No
etc etc.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> I simply had no answer apart from at the moment it happened I asked the Holy Spirit what to do, and he said &ldquo;Turn the other cheek&rdquo;, although I too judged myself on the strength/manliness/awesome<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The truth is I find out who I was &hellip; a man after God&rsquo;s heart &hellip; not mans.
I&rsquo;m fairlty happy with myself, rather sore, especially after two frisbee injuries and a carry Zay on my back injury, I really need a full body massage, but aside from these mortal injuries which will fade away, I rest secure that when squeezed, Josh produces God juice, like an orange produces orange juice.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>I was a little down today and was listening to Hillsong United on my iPhone and the song &ldquo;Reason I Live&rdquo; came on, instead of singing along as usual I listened instead.</p>
<p>They sing &ldquo;Jesus You are the reason I live&rdquo; and I thought about why I live, what purpose or hope am I straddling with all my might and power.</p>
<p>In the previous 26 years I&rsquo;ve been alive I haven&rsquo;t really been given any perplexing reason to continue on living this life I&rsquo;ve been so generously given.</p>
<p>Friends, people, workmates come and go like the wind and family has a similar flow. I&rsquo;m not working toward a financial or material prize that a mysterious person will present to me one day, nor do I know of an Eden like place where we get to go after we&rsquo;ve worked hard enough.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t confuse my rant today with an eternal existence in heaven, I&rsquo;m talking about this life, not the next.</p>
<p>As far as I know there is no medal presentation and closing ceremony somewhere soon. All I see is hard work, heartbreak, anguish and pain ahead.</p>
<p>A drunkard I picked up last weekend told me of his plan to retire before he turns 40, but not even the prospect of laziness setting in earlier than normal is attractive to me.</p>
<p>Not even a lifetime of being on radio or servanthood at my church brings a glimmer of hope to me, it just makes me want for more coffee or maybe a chill pill. The ideal of marriage and children immediately sounds good but then it just seems to perpetrate the cycle only delaying the anguish unto my children.</p>
<p>There is an exception for me though.</p>
<p>Jesus.</p>
<p>Where friends, colleauges, employers, family, politicians, pastors, girls and guys fail, Jesus stands strong and bold, with a message, instruction and hope that rings true and holds to a purpose and hope that actually has roots in something bigger and better than a smalltown family or a relationship with another person.</p>
<p>Jesus lives today and he is the reason I live. Without Jesus you wouldn&rsquo;t be reading this message today friend, because today I looked at my situation, my finances, my relationships, my responsibilities and I really didn&rsquo;t think it was worth it.</p>
<p>But then Jesus gave me some perspective.</p>
<p>He tells me about running the race and fighting the good fight. He gives me a purpose in my family, a purpose in my relationships and a purpose in situations around me.</p>
<p>Jesus teaches me about the purpose and reason in friendships, relationships, girlfriends and wives, colleagues and employers, family and relatives. Of course with all of the love and conflict that comes with the above.</p>
<p>And out of that, I realize that suicide could be the most selfish thing a man could consider to do.</p>
<p>Now before you refer me to your favourite shrink (hopefully mine will still see me after this) would you do me a favour and consider what your reason for living is, and secondly would you consider making that reason Jesus.</p>

<p>An American comedian once told a friend that he had made a new invention.</p>
<p>He tells the friend, that you get this leaf and you dry it, crush it down, roll it in paper, secure the ends, and light one end on fire. Once the end is burning you put the other end in your mouth and suck on it.</p>
<p>The friend says that sounds great, and he asks, &ldquo;Does it get you high&rdquo;. The comedian replies, &ldquo;no&rdquo;. &ldquo;Does it make you healthy&rdquo; the friend asks, the comedian replies negatively. After a few more questions with similar answers, the friend says to the comedian, &ldquo;this invention sounds great&rdquo; and walks off stunned.</p>
<p>The joke of course lies in the purpose of the cigarette, and for those in the dark, the humble cigarette provides no purpose or benefit to those of us here on earth. On Mars it may present us with something new, but for the meanwhile we will assume it has no benefits or purpose.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t had cigarette smoke enter my lungs for about 4 years now (not including my passive smoking habit I can&rsquo;t seem to kick) and I&rsquo;ve never felt better, so I write this as a man who knows the allure the paper and tobacco combination contains, but I also know the change you go through after you quit. That&rsquo;s a change you can&rsquo;t buy from a doctor or specialist, nor can you find it in any chemist or supermarket.</p>
<p>So I found it intriguing and comical that in tonight&rsquo;s sub-zero (Ed: 10 degrees celsius) temperatures my Uncle and his partner were sitting in the lounge room, with the front and back sliding doors open, smoking away.</p>
<p>They keep the doors open as a measure of kindness to the 50% of the household that don&rsquo;t smoke, which I and Rachel appreciate and am thankful for. But I still find it hilarious that they would force the household into the cold, for one simple reason &hellip; the humble cigarette.</p>
<p>I can just see the headlines in the Bulletin:
Smoking family dies of amnesia.</p>
<p>The next day in the Gold Coast Bulletin:
Stop cigarettes now! Haven&rsquo;t enough people died because of amnesia?</p>
<p>The insanity ensues.</p>

<p>Like it, love it or hate it, the ten commandments play some what of an important role in society today, many countries today have based their law on these ten simple foundations of living on earth, or as a friend once called it &ldquo;Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth&rdquo; (Hint: It&rsquo;s an acronym).</p>
<p>More importantly they are a simple rule as to whether or not you have ever sinned in your life, and this is important because if you have then there might be a few things you want to fix up before &rsquo;leaving earth'.</p>
<p>One of them more importantly is the one about parents. &ldquo;Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land the LORD your God is giving you&rdquo; is how it reads in the New International translation.</p>
<p>In a letter to the church at Ephesus, the Apostle Paul extended on this law by adding &rsquo;that all may go well with you&quot; and of course you will live long as well.</p>
<p>Is all going well in your life?</p>
<p>Is a sickness or health perhaps threatening to shorten the length of your life?</p>
<p>When I was younger, because of the crazy life I&rsquo;d led I never thought I would live past 21, which makes it a funny fact that I took the call to follow Christ at that age, some would see a symbolic act there, the age which I had prophesied I would die, I actually did, and became alive for Christ.</p>
<p>At that stage of my life I had parent issues, 6 of them to generalise, after a few divorces my dad had propagated nice little community of hate around me, luckily I had a friend in Ben Naitoko who hammered me about that commandment I wrote about earlier.</p>
<p>Out of my obedience to forgive, and honour my parents, I was launched into a completely new and exciting chapter of my life, for those watching at home, I&rsquo;m talking about my entry into the radio industry and soon after my departure to the Gold Coast.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t looked back since, I really cant afford to look back when I&rsquo;ve got so much ahead of me.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s ahead of you? A long life? All going well?</p>

			 <p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_9&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;400&rdquo; caption=&ldquo;A Nissan Patrol&rdquo;]<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[/caption]</p>
<p>On the way home tonight I dropped into Broadbeach Starbucks, more on that later, but as I left Broadbeach and got to the southern end of Surf Parade, there was a Nissan Patrol, stopped.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been slowly learning about being kind, polite, loving, all those things Jesus bangs on about in the Bible, so in respect of this teaching I sat and waited about 20 seconds until the driver realised his or her misdemeanour and snapped to it, started driving, albeit it slowly, and my journey continued.</p>
<p>The Patrol didn&rsquo;t exactly resume &rsquo;normal&rsquo; driving though. The driver continued to test my patience and love levels by stopping again, then driving very slowly, but surprisingly as we entered the Gold Coast Highway, a two lane road for everyone watching at home, I drove off &rsquo;normally&rsquo; and &rsquo;normally&rsquo; stopped at the red light, the same red light that the Nissan Patrol sped through at a high speed.</p>
<p>Continuing along the highway, two traffic lights down I pulled up to the red light and saw the Nissan Patrol, thankfully stopped at the red light this time. I looked at the driver and briefly laughed internally as I looked at the driver of the 1991 Nissan Patrol, a large brutal man car, and saw a 21-ish young girl driving, with a mobile phone wedged between her right shoulder and her ear, a stressed look on her face, and a notion that she desperately just wanted to get to the end destination of a assumed difficult trip.</p>
<p>I laughed because I sympathised with her situation, and more so, her desire to simply reach a destination. The 5 minutes I spent with her on her journey through Broadbeach and Mermaid Beach resembled my life quite a bit. Speeding through red lights, giving way to no traffic, being lost, being given bad directions, following them, and finally stopping at red lights and going at the green ones and still not being home.</p>
<p>Before this whole debacle unfolded, I had dropped into Starbucks at Broadbeach. Starbucks broadie is my personal haunt of the night. Tonight got awkward thgouh, I saw someone who had expressed an interest in me, a desire to explore the possibility of a relationship, and had even put herself out there and made a move letting me know how she felt. As Will Ferrel puts it .. she wanted to be on me. :)</p>
<p>Like the irritating male I am, I didn&rsquo;t respond to her as she would of liked, I said nothing at the time, avoided her for the appropriate length of time, then just didn&rsquo;t see her for a month.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have a problem with her, she is attractive, very nice, great personality, I just didn&rsquo;t feel like she was the girl for me. I don&rsquo;t really have any desire to go on a thousand dates with a thousand girls hoping to find the right one. My emotions are already messed up enough without mixing more girls to the mix. So I simply didn&rsquo;t communicate with her.</p>
<p>I saw her tonight, and the moment she took a glance at me, as I stood in line about 4 people back, with two drunk girls and two emo girls filling the great divide between us, I knew exactly how she felt. I&rsquo;ve been in her shoes before, put my whole heart on the line, only to have it ignored, smashed or the worst one: wrenched and twisted. It sucks, you bet all you&rsquo;ve got then walk home with nothing.</p>
<p>So after an awkward conversation with her, a hilarious glance from the other barista who knew the whole story and a Grande Signature Hot Chocolate on skinny soy milk, I moved along quickly as &lsquo;The Casual Projects&rsquo; would recommend doing (reference to song lyrics in the song &ldquo;Move Along&rdquo;). Back in the warmth of my car, and the comfort of my own company.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m sure everyone is asking how a Nissan Patrol changed my life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had this notion somehow from when I was a child, that we were always somehow, someday hoping to reach the point of completion of whatever it is we are currently doing, and it would be a day of celebration, the Mayor or maybe even the Prime Minister would come along and make a speech, and then everything would be ok.</p>
<p>But it seems, after 26.5 years of hard yakka, that this quite possibly might not happen, and this thing I experience every day as I wake up, we call it &rsquo;life&rsquo;, might be a journey of significant length, perhaps not a quick 100m sprint that I hoped it was.</p>
<p>At the thought of this I felt so wrong and disappointed with myself that I almost straightened my hair, wore all my black clothes, got out my Kisschasy CD and bought some weird coloured knee length socks.</p>
<p>So, having not turned emo, I thought as we travel this journey of life, running red lights and stopping at intersections for no particular reason, holding up journeymen and journeywomen behind us, in general having no idea what on earth we are doing at all, despite the libraries being full of great books and having friends and family that seem to just have the answer to everything, maybe we&rsquo;re not as wrong as we feel. You might of noticed the change from I to we, that&rsquo;s right, I&rsquo;ve dragged you into this now.</p>
<p>Collectively as a race of people we&rsquo;re more intelligent and rich than ever before, yet more depressed and hard up than we&rsquo;ve ever felt and I know that more than often we feel wrong. We feel like we&rsquo;ve made a mistake, or we&rsquo;ve made a boo boo, an error or a royal stuff up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been there &hellip; just today I&rsquo;ve stuffed up at least three times &hellip; possibly four, Ash Punch and Jon King can fill you in on the details I&rsquo;m sure, but the truth is that the friendships and relationships I have here on earth and the grace of God that I receive from heaven quite simply mops up everything I&rsquo;ve done wrong, all the red lights I&rsquo;ve ran today on today&rsquo;s journey, and all the other driving mishaps, its all gone after today, and tomorrow, thank God, is a new day.</p>
<p>So as a Nissan Patrol did to me today, let me do the same to you, and encourage you to fight the good fight and run the good race, and let it be known that you are on a journey that quite possibly could go right to the end of your life and quite possibly even after, although along the journey you will sometimes pickup a hitchhiker or drop someone off and sometimes you&rsquo;ll even pull in somewhere for a little longer than normal, it is still a journey, and God put you on it to enjoy it and enjoy it to the full.</p>

<ol>
<li>If sports are involved, fist bumping is always acceptable.</li>
<li>If you are wearing a suit, you may only fist bump if you have just wrapped part of your suit around your forehead.</li>
<li>You may not fist bump under any circumstances, in a hospital. Unless Rule #1 (or Rule #2) applies.</li>
<li>Do not fist bump someone else’s misfortune, even if it helps you. Just look down, furrow your brow, and nod sternly.</li>
<li>No fist bumping between the hours of 7am and 10am. And if you’re watching sports at this time, it’s probably soccer or NASCAR, and then you should really not be fist bumping. High fives will suffice for both.</li>
<li>Do not fist bump in a meeting. This overrides rules #1 and #2.</li>
<li>Do not fist bump your children.</li>
<li>Girls can fist bump anytime they want. And yes, guys think it’s cute.</li>
<li>Do not refuse a fist bump. If you, as a bumpee, believe the bumper is violating a rule, speak to him afterwards. Refusing his bump is not going to help anything.</li>
<li>Do not fist bump yourself.</li>
