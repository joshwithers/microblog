[Happy 10th birthday [@patrickc](https://micro.blog/patrickc) + Stripe](https://twitter.com/patrickc/status/1443289393695911938?s=21), about six and a half years ago we took the bold step to take credit card payments through our website, bold because almost no-one was doing it in the wedding industry. It worked out well.
