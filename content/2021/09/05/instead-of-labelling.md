Instead of labelling antivaxxers or vaccine-hesitant people as stupid etc, could we consider how we as a society have contributed to the rapid distrust of elected officials and pharmaceutical companies?

I'm married to a vaccine hesitant person and she's not stupid. But she finds valid and real reason to distrust the choir of voices singing the "just get vaccinated, ya know" song.

Honestly, she brings more reading material, albeit embroiled in conjecture, than the "hey idiots, blindly believe the govt and just get vaxxed" crowd.

I'm tired.

Welcome to my TED Talk.
