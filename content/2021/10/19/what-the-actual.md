What the actual? The notification takes you to the iCloud Backup section of settings to make sure you’re backed up before you switch to a new iPad?!

I have not purchased a new iPad, do not intend to, nor do I need to, this one is months old.

I know that ultimately this is a tech error inside Apple, but damn you’re looking creepy Apple.
