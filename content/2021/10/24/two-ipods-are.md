These two computers are two of my favourite Apple computers. The iMac G4, the white Intel MacBook, and my current Apple Silicon MacBook Air are up there as well, but these two were the first computers I fell in love with.

The first, the iPod Shuffle. A computer without a screen with seven buttons and two ports. 512MB of my favourite songs shuffled. I have vivid memories of walking to work with this wonder of a computer.

The second, the iPhone I bought when I couldn't buy an iPhone, the iPod Touch, released in Australia while the iPhone was USA only.

Happy 20th birthday, iPod, you've run a good race.
