Steve Jobs’s [resume](https://web.archive.org/web/20100106211429/http://homepage.mac.com/steve/Resume.html):

> “I’m looking for a fixer-upper with a solid foundation. Am willing to tear down walls, build bridges, and light fires. I have great experience, lots of energy, a bit of that ‘vision thing’ and I’m not afraid to start from the beginning.”
