Deconstructing your Christianity. A few links for friends.

Four episodes of The Naked Church podcast, episodes [eight](https://anchor.fm/the-naked-church/episodes/EP008---Deconstructing-your-Christianity-Part-1-e12np89/a-a5sgbej), [nine](https://anchor.fm/the-naked-church/episodes/EP009---Deconstructing-your-Christianity-Part-2-e137dti/a-a5v13jt), [ten](https://anchor.fm/the-naked-church/episodes/EP010---Deconstructing-your-Christianity-Part-3-e14qp09/a-a66gh5i), and [eleven](https://anchor.fm/the-naked-church/episodes/EP011---Deconstructing-your-Christianity-Part-4-e15ld0t/a-a6aaolh).

[The Irresistible Revolution by Shane Claiborne](https://www.amazon.com/Irresistible-Revolution-Updated-Expanded-Ordinary/dp/0310343704/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&qid=1633417711&s=books&sr=1-1) started ruining everything for me over a decade ago.

[The Universal Christ, by Richard Rohr](https://www.amazon.com.au/Universal-Christ-Forgotten-Reality-Everything/dp/1524762091).

[Finding God in the Waves, by Mike McHargue](https://www.amazon.com.au/Finding-God-Waves-Mike-McHargue/dp/147365369X/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&qid=1633417472&s=books&sr=1-1).

[Rob Bell's Everything is Spiritual](https://www.amazon.com/Everything-Spiritual-What-Were-Doing/dp/1250620562).

[Love Matters More by Jared Byas](https://www.amazon.com/Love-Matters-More-Fighting-Loving/dp/0310358604/).

[Comedy Sex God by Pete Holmes](https://www.amazon.com.au/Comedy-Sex-God-Pete-Holmes/dp/0062803972) plus everything Pete Holmes has ever done including the TV show, Crashing, which is amazing.

And finally, [The Liturgists podcast](https://theliturgists.com), which went full deconstruction years ago and came around again. Listen to it all, it's a wild ride.

Deconstructing and rebuilding your faith is an interesting journey, and the best is yet to come.
