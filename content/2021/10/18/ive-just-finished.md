I’ve just finished the seven episode podcast, [9/12](https://podnews.net/podcast/i9c9u), which tells the story of a post 9/11 America, and crescendoes to a beautiful finale. It’s a valuable story to engage with, not just what happened on 11 September 2001, but how the world responded, and why we “never forget”.
