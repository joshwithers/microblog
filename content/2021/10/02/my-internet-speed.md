Blogging this so that somewhere in my internet history is a record of a time when I was really impressed that for multiple days in a row I actually got broadband speeds close to what was being sold: 1000/50.


I hope that in 20 years when I read this it will be a laughable joke that such pitiful speeds were the best you could get in 2021 on former Telstra HFC (Hybrid fiber-coaxial).
