I auditioned to join the Kyle & Jackie O show in 2011 & was flown to Sydney. In the interview the EP asked if it was ok for Kyle to call me a c*\*t, so him defending Denis Handlin isn’t surprising. I was ok with ‘the name’ but quit radio soon after cause life’s too short.

I was so excited for the gig and remember walking away thinking that if that was the top of the ladder, I didn’t want to climb the ladder anymore.
