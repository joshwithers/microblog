Registration is officially open for the Wedding Business CEO Summit!

This summit is hosted by, and created by my friend Heidi, to help wedding business owners go from overwhelmed & overworked to streamlined & more profitable than ever.
 
I’m speaking along with 24 other incredible speakers with topics ranging from finances, pricing, integration, going full-time and everything in between. I'm talking about creating a meaningful and fun customer journey!
 
The summit kicks off on Australia Day and it’s going to be 5 action-packed days that you won’t want to miss!
