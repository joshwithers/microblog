New podcast recommendation: [Queens Of The Drone Age](https://queensofthedroneage.com)!

It’s a new podcast, two episodes deep so far, and it’s hosted by four Australian tech journalists/nerds in media.

It’s a well recorded and produced show, and really accessible. It might be about tech and the culture surrounding tech, but it’s not a nerd-show. It’s really accessible to listen to for people who might like and appreciate tech things but aren’t nerds like me.

Search for, or click through to, [Queens Of The Drone Age](https://queensofthedroneage.com).
