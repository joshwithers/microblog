A friend kindly and jokingly mentioned that life for us looked to be all fun going by social media recently.

And life is pretty fine, but ...

So I thought I'd share what the first half of just today has been for me.

- 2 couples cancelling.
- 3 couples moving to new dates, two of those in different cities both moved to dates next to each other so that's four weddings in a row that week in July.
- 1 couple who have had 2 New Zealand bookings with us already, and we've been working with them since November 2019 on their elopement bookings, are now fighting for a refund because they just want to get married now despite WA closing their borders again.
- 2 flights cancelled, with new tickets issued after a call to Qantas, but with one of the flights we now need to fly in a day earlier - so I'm not home for Britt's birthday - but the accomodation isn't available a day earlier so we need to get extra accomodation and of course, at our own cost because imagine if I asked the couple to pay for it because Qantas isn't flying out of Gold Coast that day.
- 3 wedding enquiries replied to.
- 4 mentoring and support replies to Celebrant Institute members needing business support.
- Plus our home which we haven't been in since March last year because we rented it out so we could travel to weddings and elopements around the globe for a year, has a pool problem so I'm on the phone with the pool company and the real estate trying to not spend thousands fixing a pool problem that wouldn't have happened if we were in our home.

Which is all fine, seriously, this is just my job, and I'm doing it.

But this is simply four hours of a Friday morning in my life sitting in a Hobart Airbnb about to drive two hours to an elopement that was supposed to happen in Tuscany last year for the loveliest couple who I legally married last March when we were sure we'd be in Italy in July for them.

I'm honestly just really over it all.

It's been 319 days since we were in our home and our business was 100% fun and I feel like we're being forced to apologise for running a successful international wedding business.
