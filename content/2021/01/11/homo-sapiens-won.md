Research shows that Homo neanderthalensis (otherwise known as Neanderthals, the species of people that didn’t survive where we did) was more intelligent and had a bigger brain than Homo sapiens, but Sapiens, Humans, were connected. We were social.

We won not because of our intellect but because of our sociability.

"If Neanderthals were a super-fast computer, we were an old-fashioned PC – with wi-fi. We were slower, but better connected."

From the book I’m currently reading, "Humankind: A Hopeful History" by Rutger Bregman.
