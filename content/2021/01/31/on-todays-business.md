On today's business to-do list:

- Answer a complaint from the Office Of Fair Trading about a couple who changed their 2020 wedding date to a day I wasn't available for, and then was available for but then they didn't want me, and who weren't eligible for a refund, but got a 50% refund any way and they've taken us to the OFT for the remaining 50%.
- Respond to a credit card chargeback for an elopement that was supposed to be in New Zealand last September but they moved it to April 2021 and just recently decided they wanted to get married now in Western Australia while the borders were closed.
- File another couple's wedding cancellation.
- Freak out about the calendar for the rest of the year because almost every new enquiry I'm not available for because last year's weddings are now in this year's calendar unless of course they're taking us to court because COVID ruined their wedding and they expect refunds from small businesses when even Qantas only gives credit vouchers.
- Apply to a court to actually hold a hearing regarding a refund complaint for a Brisbane couple who had booked us for a Western Australian elopement but because WA closed their borders we all couldn't get there so instead of planning something in the possible they took us to court and the court didn't hold a hearing it just ruled in their favour so I now need to ask them to set that ruling aside wtf?
- Take more photos of Luna.
- Get in-house legal counsel?
- Procrastinate on social media.
- Wonder if there'll be a SanityKeeper? I don't want your money, ScoMo, I just want to go to Hawaii whilst this bushfire burns.
