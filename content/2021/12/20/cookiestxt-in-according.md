[Reading through this beautiful 1994 email remnant of a Microsoft that was trying to beat Apple and Unix from owning the Internet](https://sriramk.com/memos/KillerApp.pdf), apart from the zinger after zinger, my favourite element is the very innocent 1994 version of a COOKIES.TXT. The file was about baking cookies, the food ones. So sweet and innocent.
