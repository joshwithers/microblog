From today's edition of Josh Spector's [For the Interested email](https://fortheinterested.com):

> “At the start of the 1990s, no one cared about the Seattle music scene.

> That was a problem for the founders of indie record label Sub Pop, who couldn't get any LA or New York music journalists to pay attention to their bands (including Nirvana).

> So they got creative.

> They flew out a British music journalist for a few days, set up a bunch of shows and introduced him to the Seattle scene.

>He found it cool and wrote a big story about it.

> That piece caught the attention of US journalists who suddenly thought they were missing something in their own backyard, and that launched the Grunge era.”
