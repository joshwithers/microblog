> “A tribe without enemies is, almost by definition, not a tribe. As a consequence, tribal dispute and warfare is part of what defines humanity.”

> “Things have changed a lot since. The biggest enemy we have to fight against right now is our tribal past. What served us so well for thousands of years is now an obsolete concept. It’s no more about the survival of this tribe or that one, but about Homo sapiens as a species. … For the first time in our collective history, we must think of ourselves as a single tribe on a single planet. ... We are a single tribe, the tribe of humans. And, as such, not a tribe at all.”

— Marcelo Gleiser in “The Trouble with Tribalism” via Tim Ferriss’s email.
