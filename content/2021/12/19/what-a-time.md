What a time to be alive. When Dawkins defined a meme as “unit of cultural information spread by imitation” he was definitely thinking of [Sidetalk NYC’s Thanksgiving on IG](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CWtZ94QjAVA/) spreading to the [Jonas Brothers in the Whitehouse on Tiktok](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSe5hMoUd/). Bing bong.
