Just imagine if somehow, if there was some way, we all had the power to not laugh at Australian indigenous girls dancing on a navy ship.

The problem isn't with twerking, especially considering how misleading the ABC was with the story, the problem is with our insistence on finding problems with things that really aren't problems.

We're so angry.
