Very very few stories are worth telling in their infancy. Most require research, understanding, context, empathy, and nuance.

For example, what if a story about girls twerking on a navy ship in front of the Governor General was held onto for a a day and some research was done?

But we as a society have decided not to invest in that research. We complain if a news website needs us to pay a subscription, and we scream about defunding the ABC if they don't say what we want.

So we end up with an angry story that's not entirely true, based on the premise that girls shouldn't dance on boats.

If you think about it, aren't we all twerking seamen on the navy ship of our lives? Thanks for getting to the end of this, I really just wanted you to consider yourself as a twerking sailor.
