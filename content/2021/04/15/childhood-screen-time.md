A link between childhood “screen time” and attention problems has failed to replicate in this study.

> We evaluated 848 models, including logistic regression as per the original paper, plus linear regression and two forms of propensity score analysis. Only 166 models (19.6%) yielded a statistically significant relationship between early TV exposure and later attention problems, with most of these employing problematic analytic choices.

The funny thing is that I know that Luna's mood changes when she has spent time in front of the TV, she's less co-operative and less joyful, despite really enjoying TV, and strongly desiring it at various times.

So maybe TV as a child doesn't affect their attention, but it does affect their sensibilities, in my humble opinion as a father of two.
