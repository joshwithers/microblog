> "I promise you that no-one is coming for your son's head. The data is clear, the number of false accusations that stick is negligible. If your son does not cross the line, if he doesn't teeter on the "edge of consent", if he doesn't misuse his power to control or belittle others, he will be just fine. But it's not bad behaviour we should be getting out in front of, extinguishing potential fires. We should expect more of our boys. We should be expecting good behaviour, because when it comes down to it, we all want our men to grow up feeling powerful and strong, but in their values of equality, respect and dignity."
