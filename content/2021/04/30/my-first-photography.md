Pretty proud of this.

For the first time since it was built last year, Iâ€™ve witnessed my first and only commissioned photo in person, at the Reece Bathroom Life showroom in St Leonards, Sydney.

One of the staff tell me that someone was asking about it last week because their bathroom has no windows and they wanted it in their bathroom.

No-one thought that I could go from cow photographer to bathroom photographer so quickly.
