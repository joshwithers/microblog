In 2014 the Prime Minister's Office [published this report](https://www.pmc.gov.au/sites/default/files/publications/Value_of_Statistical_Life_guidance_note.pdf) noting that the statistical value of a human life was $4.2M in 2014 terms - which is more like $4.6M today.

I wonder how this factors into the equations around covid-19 reduction measures?

Whether the measures enacted over the last year are "within the budget" or if they "over spent"?
