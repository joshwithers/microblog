I really enjoy making photos.

This photo is one of my favourites, it's of an unknown hiker taking a breather at Taft Point in Yosemite National Park.

Something I'm struggled with for the longest time is that I identify as a celebrant, that's what I do, but I really enjoy making photos of, and for, people.

If you've been married by me, you've probably received a text message after your wedding with a sneaky photo, and an apology to your photographer for cutting their grass. 

That's my modus operandi, I'm already at an epic location for a sweet wedding, and there's another photographer there directing, creating, expressing, and I steal a shot in the background. Most are pretty cool with it, and some, like my mate James Day, have been encouraging me in it for a while now. But it's a bit cheap of me to steal other people's shots, the real thing to do, is to make my own.

So today when I met with a couple about making photos at their wedding I felt so excited at the prospect of a new avenue of creativity for me, and the possibility of creating meaningful and enjoyable work for you.

I don't have a photography website, or portfolio, or packages, or prices. I've been a wedding celebrant for over 12 years now, and I love doing that, but somewhere along the way I'll figure out how me making photos can be a thing I market, but for now, feel free to check out the really quick portfolio I made with Adobe today so I had something to show the couple today, at [www.joshwithers.photos](https://www.joshwithers.photos) and if you're willing to take a bet on a celebrant making photos at your wedding, slide on in to those DMs
