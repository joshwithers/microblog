Forgive me for thinking that the Victorian government doesn’t know what is going on.

I just transited through Melbourne Airport from Tugun (Gold Coast) to Hobart.

Applying for a transit permit: fine.
Getting the travel permit: you’ve been in an orange or red zone (no I haven’t)
Arriving in Victoria: “let me check with my supervisor, I think we need to escort you”
An hour after arriving in Hobart: You need to quarantine.

Get it together guys.
