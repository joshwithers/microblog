Since the moment Steve Jobs introduced us to the iPhone, Australian users have had bad weather data.

The Australian Bureau of Meteorology is the only true source of weather data in Australia, but Apple sources it’s data from Weather.com, even though it owns Dark Sky now. That said, Dark Sky’s data doesn’t seem accurate in Australia either.

But it doesn’t matter how you skin it, Apple Weather has had bad data [for a long time](https://joshwithers.blog/2021/05/01/four-different-weather.html), and it continues in iOS 15.

Here’s comparisons from three apps, Apple Weather, Carrot Westher which is sourcing its data from Willyweather which I’m guessing it licensed from the BoM, and the one true BoM app.

Apple Weather developers, if you want to source true weather data, [this is a great place to start.](http://reg.bom.gov.au/catalogue/data-feeds.shtml)
