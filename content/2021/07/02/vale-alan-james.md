Today, Britt and I attended - remotely via live stream - the [memorial service](https://vimeo.com/570136243) of her grandfather, [Alan James Snow](http://let.josh.show/Alan-Snow/Alan-Snow.pdf).

Alan's life story is wide ranging and interesting, from his time in the [NSW Police](https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/after-a-lifetime-of-policing-peace-in-prints-20191025-p5347b.html) through to his large and international legacy in his family.

On the 1st of November 2013, while Alan was visiting his son in Queensland, I took the opportunity to record a podcast episode with him. I've always wanted to record the stories of people around us, but as often happens, time and priorities get in the way. So today, I'm proud to share this hour-long recording today with our family, and anyone else wanting to.
