Off to court today for the third couple who had booked us for an international ceremony wedding but would now prefer a refund over a reschedule.

This pandemic is a daily nightmare for us, but hey, weâ€™re all this together, we can do it Queensland, so things will be ok eventually.

The fun thing is trying to convince future couples that our expenses have gone up so our prices have gone up.

Fuck covid.
