It's been made aware to me that some of my social media broadcasts over the last year might paint me as some sort of person, politically etc.

Please do not look to me for epidemiological advice or policy. I am a hurting man who has lost much and continues to lose more. 

I'm not the one to look for on whether borders should open or close, or if you should alter your DNA to survive a pandemic.

However, if you'd like specific advice on how to not look like you're crying in public please DM me. It's basically about pretending you were laughing instead.
