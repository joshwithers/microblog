Pro-vax, anti-vax, pro-lockdown, anti-lockdown, everyone's trying to join a team, but so few people are understanding the hurt that others are feeling. Whilst you might be annoyed by wearing a masking, or other people not-wearing a mask, all whilst your income, stability, and quality of life hasn't changed in the last year, many have lost more than they'd care to mention, or even have the words to describe.

We don't need to be right. No-one cares if you're right.

We need to care, we need empathy, we need consideration and understanding.

Because in 300 years when we're all dust, no-one's going to be telling stories about how right you were. But they'll speak about our legacy of empathy and care.
