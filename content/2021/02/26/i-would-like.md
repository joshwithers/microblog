I would like to make a public statement regarding the most recent episode, number 175, of the [Wedding Photo Hangover podcast](https://weddinghangover.com).

If you listen to that podcast you may hear me say stupid and offensive things. Alas, that was not me. My voice was hacked. I was just dropping the kids off in the podcast. Jenny and I spoke last night and she said to me, you have to think about this as a Prime Minister, just say you were hacked.

[This is a link to the episode I was in no way on](https://anchor.fm/weddingphotohangover/episodes/Ep--175---Switching-to-the-M1-Mac-and-Toot-Toot-Caboose-with-Josh-Withers-eqv9lh) - please do not listen.
