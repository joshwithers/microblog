[This story](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ki6fnd/oregon_i_accidentally_created_an_army_of_crow/) is my favourite story of today, plus, [the update](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/lobhtj/oregon_i_accidentally_created_an_army_of_crow/) makes it even better.

> "I accidentally created an army of crow body guards. Am I liable if my murder attempts murder?”
