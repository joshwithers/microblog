My February 2021 Apple Fitness challenge is to walk 227km in the month. So I was out late last night closing in on the target when I stopped and looked at the bus timetable sign at a local bus stop.

That NFC tag piqued my curiosity. I wondered if it worked on iPhone?

So I tapped my iPhone 12 Pro up against the NFC logo and a website hyperlink notification popped up like when you scan a QR code.

And TransLink, the local public transport provider, had neglected to renew the domain name used in the NFC tag.

I now own the [transl.in](http://transl.in/) domain name and the people of the Gold Coast now have easy access to my website. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

As an example, a local bus stop links to [http://transl.in/k_300428](http://transl.in/k_300428)
