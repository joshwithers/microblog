James Gandolfini, aka Tony Soprano, was paid [$3M by HBO to reject a $5M offer](https://deadline.com/2021/07/talking-sopranos-podcast-ricky-gervais-james-gandolfini-the-office-hbo-paid-3million-to-forego-1234793375/) to be the new boss on The Office. We should really be paying people like @darrenhayes to not [sell out our high school memories for food mountain](https://twitter.com/darrenhayes/status/1422341406455078923?s=21).
