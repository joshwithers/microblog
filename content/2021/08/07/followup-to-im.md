I've been extraordinarily blessed to have so many phone calls, messages, offers of help regarding my recent post, [I'm not ok](https://joshwithers.blog/2021/08/07/a-wedding-celebrants.html).

I wanted to offer a few follow-up remarks:

1. Donations: Some of the world's most generous people have made offers of finance to us. I won't say no, that's rude, but I also am not asking. We're provided for today, and luckily we have things to sell.
2. Getting a new job: I have very mixed feelings about this. One one hand, I'm a really good celebrant, and people like what I create, and I've been blessed to create weddings around the globe, literally from Iceland to New Zealand and everywhere in between, and I really enjoy(ed) celebrancy before March 2020. On the other hand I have a responsibility to provide for myself and my family, and if one job isn't available, get a new job. I'm honestly open to job offers for those who know my background and skills, the problem is that I have a large backlog of weddings and elopements that have to get done some day, and that would seemingly be a large burden to a new employer, to have me having random days off.
3. My mental health: I think I'm ok mostly in that regard. I know that the last 17 months have been traumatic and left me scarred, but I'm not sitting here thinking bad thoughts. That said, I could do with seeing someone, I just don't want to see the kind of psychologists I've seen in the past who seem quite clinical and have great breathing techniques - they're fine - but I know how to breath now. I don't know who I need to see, or if I can afford that, but if you know, let me know.
4. Gratitude: A former colleague from when I was on breakfast radio, was kind enough and generous enough to lend me his ear over the phone recently, but he had a hidden and kind motive, to introduce me to [The Resilience Project](https://theresilienceproject.com.au), so I'm working my way through that idea and working on a gratitude journal, and trying to get into that headspace. It's not natural to me, but I'm getting there. Thanks Mat, you've always been so good to me.
5. Further gratitude: As I've mentioned, so many have been kind enough to share, comment, tweet, message, DM, email me. You guys are the real MVP. I wanted to share for the same reason Britt and I shared we were pregnant with Goldie before the "time" you're supposed to tell everyone. When we lost our first baby we told everyone a few days before we found out that the pregnancy wasn't continuing. That sucked, but it was the best situation, because our friends and family were on the journey with us. Thank you for being on the journey with us. I don't share for pity or to ask for donations. I share because we're all in this together, warts and all.

TL;DR:

> I'm ok, but not ok, and I'd like new work, but it's complicated, and I have skills. I should talk to someone, but I talked to Mat, and I'm grateful. Thank you.
