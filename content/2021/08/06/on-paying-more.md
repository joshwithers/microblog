> "Most people try to negotiate the lowest possible price when paying for a service. That's a mistake. Because if you "win," you may save some money but are likely to be the lowest priority for that service provider as a result. On the flipside, if you pay a bit MORE than the typical price, you become that service provider's highest priority. You'll wind up getting way more value for your money."
