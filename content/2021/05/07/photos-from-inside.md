Photos from inside my house identify as photos taken at houses down the street, from a GPS angle I understand this, but my iPhone knows my home address, and the wifi SSID I’m connected to overnight every night, surely we could bring that data together and say “if he’s on this wifi SSID, and GPS is weak or non-existent, maybe the actual photo and AirTag location is ‘home’”?
