I first heard this song on in August 1995, discovering it on one of the Windows 95 installation CDs in the ‘Fun Stuff’ folder - left there to demonstrate the video-playing capabilities of Windows 95.

To listen to it in Dolby Atmos spatial audio today is quite a stretch from whatever low-res MPEG codec I heard in 1995.
