"It's not all men, but it's only men."

Those are some tough words to read, thank you for sharing Damien Johnson.

It's not all men, but it is all people who look like me, who identify like I do, it is people who I could be mistaken for, or more importantly, people who I don't fear but are fearful to other people.

I was thinking about the time that Dale and Barney and I were bashed up by a bunch of guys only meters from the cafe strip in Broadbeach, that was the first and last time I've ever been scared for my life, and I'm lead to believe that so many women feel that level of fear a lot more than I ever have.

I believe that a real inhibitor in the conversation about all this

To my brothers who feel threatened by the current movement, my encouragement would be that if you've done no wrong, if you're not abusing your position by suggesting or insinuating sexual motives towards women who you have no right to do so to, then we have nothing to fear.

Stand by our girls and let them know you're sick of it to, because I sure am. We can't go back from this, we can't go around it, or over it, we need to go through it.

Girls, I'm with you, it is ridiculous that you should feel fear to be in public alone, for it to be our default position that you are not safe in the presence of unknown men, and even worse than that, for you not to be safe in the presence of known men.

It's not all men, but it's only men.
