“If cancel culture were real, Daryl Somers, who built a career and life on the back of a show where he did and said a lot of questionable things, would not feel comfortable publicly complaining about cancel culture. If cancel culture were real, Somers would not be giving an interview in a newspaper while doing press for his new job hosting a popular show on national television.” - [The Age](https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/an-old-white-man-walks-into-a-bar-have-you-heard-this-joke-20210326-p57eds.html)
