No-one's betting on a 2% chance of winning anything. If there's a 2% chance of anything happening, that basically means the thing isn't happening. Our doctor said there would be a 2% chance of us ever falling pregnant, and an even lower chance of us having two children.

But by God's grace we've won that lottery twice now, so I'd love to introduce you to our little girl born yesterday, 4kg and healthy as you could ever hope for, please say hello to Goldie Grace Withers.

Thank you so much to our friend [Bec Zacher](https://www.beczacher.com) for these amazing photos.
