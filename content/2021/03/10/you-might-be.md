You might be surprised to find out that Harry & Meghan are not the first people to get married before they got married.

Iâ€™ve married so many people who have wanted to take back their getting married moment from their family, then gone along with the family wedding weeks/months later just to keep everyone happy.

Kind of sad that family would impose so heavily, in my humble opinion.
