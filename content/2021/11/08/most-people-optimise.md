> "Most people optimise for the day ahead. A few people optimise for 1-2 years ahead. Almost nobody optimises for 3-4 years ahead (or longer).

> The person who is willing to delay gratification longer than most reduces competition and gains a decisive advantage.

> Patience is power."

â€“ James Clear
