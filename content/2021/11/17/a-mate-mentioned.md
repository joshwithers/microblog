A mate mentioned pirating software and it took me right back to 20 years ago where we had a keygen or a hack or serial number for ecverything.

They really were the good ol days, access to the world's software, entertainment, and media, the only cost was time, so much time waiting for the painfully slow internet to bring you the goods.

It’s a hard position to advocate for - piracy - but letting kids have free access to software created a generation of modern creatives and tech professionals. Back then, to learn Photoshop or CAD or programming we’d pirate it, now you’ve got to pony up dollars every month. How do kids today learn this stuff without paying thousands of dollars they don’t havre for it?
