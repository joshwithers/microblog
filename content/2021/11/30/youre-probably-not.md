From [David Perell's Monday Musings email](https://ckarchive.com/b/gkunh5h0me8q):

> Whenever you find yourself thinking you’re late to a new technological trend, remember that Walt Disney thought he was late to animation in 1923.
​
> On the same theme, Marc Andreessen thought he’d missed the Silicon Valley boom when he arrived in 1994. He said: “My big feeling was I just missed it, I missed the whole thing. It had happened in the ‘80s, and I got here too late.”
​
> According to one of my Twitter followers, some of the earliest written fragments from Sumer in 3,000 BCE show people complaining that all the good subjects had already been covered by earlier poets.
