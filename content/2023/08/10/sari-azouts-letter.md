Sari Azout's "[letter to a friend who is thinking of starting something new](https://sublimeinternet.substack.com/p/letter-to-a-friend-who-is-thinking)" is beautiful. As Sari subtitles it, 'if you are thinking of leaving your job to start a company or passion project, this letter is for you too.'

> 1. Will you use this opportunity to grow and evolve or will you use it to beat yourself up?  
> 2. How will you avoid insecurity work?
> 3. Can you learn to enjoy the process as the end in itself, not the means?
> 4. Can you learn to enjoy the process as the end in itself, not the means?
> 5. Will you default to the norms of your industry, or will you be an original?
> 6. What tools will you use to quiet your ego and see reality clearly?
> 7. Do you have clarity on what kind of financial value you aim to create?

If I had a beef to pick with anyone in the world today it's how so many of us let life happen to us instead of us making us happen to life.

> I hope you get to know your inner world. I hope you thrive financially while living your values. I hope you focus less on what you achieve and more on who you become. I hope you learn to be kind to yourself. I hope you fall in love with the process. I hope you see the point of pursuing passion work is not to drain yourself to create work that eclipses your life, but rather to create a life you are proud of. I hope this new venture takes you far away from conformism and enables you to make a life and a living on your own terms, with your spirit and creativity unhindered.

With any luck you're reading this article well after I first shared it in August 2023, and if this is the case I felt the need to find the link and send it to you as you consider embarking on something new.

Make this process mean something so we have a cool story to talk about in a decade's time.
