Jake Meador in [The Misunderstood Reason Millions of Americans Stopped Going to Church](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/christian-church-communitiy-participation-drop/674843/) in The Atlantic:

> Contemporary America simply isn’t set up to promote mutuality, care, or common life. Rather, it is designed to maximize individual accomplishment as defined by professional and financial success. Such a system leaves precious little time or energy for forms of community that don’t contribute to one’s own professional life or, as one ages, the professional prospects of one’s children. Workism reigns in America, and because of it, community in America, religious community included, is a math problem that doesn’t add up.

If there was a major crime cast on society in the last generation it was this. The simple idea that professional and financial success reign.
