Three years ago today [I called for](https://www.facebook.com/therebelsguide/posts/pfbid0BcV9Z41sAg7e9v7MwdtMYnQvZGUFA3Gdfuv2URaQQJkpJZMCmnXSdQeQfmokYH91l) a new Saint to be named in Melbourne. turns out Aussies are super compliant and boring so nothing happened.

> Saint Valentine of Rome was martyred on February 14 in AD 269 after he continued marrying people when marriage was banned. Weddings are banned in Melbourne from Thursday. Will there be a Saint of Batmania?
