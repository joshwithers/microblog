I'm a part of the Hobart wedding trail coming up in a few weeks. I'm expecting a great crowd to fly down and come and jump on a bus or boat and check out the Tasmanian wedding scene. My friend Nina at [Isle Weddings](https://www.isleweddings.com.au/trail-2/) is hosting, check out her website for more info.
