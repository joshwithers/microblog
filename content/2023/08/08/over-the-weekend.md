Over the weekend I wrote [a piece about the fluff coming out of commercial radio in Australia](https://joshwithers.blog/2023/08/06/commercial-radio-isnt.html), referencing my own time in a commercial radio station in very remote Western Australia, and considering going back last year but the wage had actually decreased.

Anyway, it was poorly written, so sitting at Gate F6 in Vienna Airport just now I edited and fixed it.

Any other errors or omissions are the faulty of your web browser.
