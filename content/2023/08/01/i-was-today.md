I was today years old when I learned that the word 'homographic' didn't mean what my brain assumed it meant.

> **homograph** - *noun* each of two or more words spelled the same but not necessarily pronounced the same and having different meanings and origins.

Like the word bass means a fish, an instrument, and a sound range.

Not recorded images or photos of certain people doing things.
