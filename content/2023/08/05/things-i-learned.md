Things I learned today:

1) When you drive many kilometres past beautiful sunflower fields in Tuscany full of big and ripe sunflowers ready to be in a florist's shop window, five days later when you go back to photograph them they'll be harvested and in shop windows.

2) Sunflowers follow the sun, so when you go out to shoot them at sunrise, they're all looking down like they've been listening to Nothing Compares 2 U on repeat since they found out about Sinead.

3) "Sunflowers at sunrise in fog" isn't the epic photo I hoped for.
