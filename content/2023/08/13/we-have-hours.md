We have 48 hours left in Paris. I'm I'm curious what your one awesome thing to do, see, eat, or photograph in Paris. We travel slow, don't travel like tourists, don't really hit the common "top 10 things to see" lists, and we're travelling with two kids, so sometimes we miss things that everyone thinks is awesome. Give me your one recommendation.
