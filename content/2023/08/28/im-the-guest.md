I'm the guest on the most recent episode of Polka Dot Wedding's Feel Good Wedding Podcast. My audio recording isn't great because it was recorded in a small tiled Italian co-working office room, but the sentiment is great: getting married can be and should be awesome and enjoyable.

Listen [on their website](https://withe.rs/wKXc) or in [your podcast app of choice](https://podnews.net/podcast/iarve/listen).

And thank you to Dorothy and Mary for having me :)
