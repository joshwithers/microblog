We're packing and getting ready for our homeward journey tonight in Paris. We've got three flights left, and the longest ones just earned us a text message from Qantas letting us know that the four of us had been upgraded to business class (RIP my points balance). We've got a few nights in Singapore left and it's back to the Southern Gold Coast after almost a year away.

So because I'm a big nerd, these are our family travel stats since we left home last September and listed our home on Airbnb:

- Photos on my phone: 10,017
- Days away from home: 354
- Flight hours: 87
- Airbnbs and hotel rooms: 52
- Flights: 50
- Airports: 23
- Cars (rented/borrowed/owned): 17
- Countries: 10
- Boats: 3
- Children: 2
- Eurostars: 1
- MacBooks that survived a glass of whisky being spilt on them: 0
- Brown hairs left on my head: -6
