Will, a mate of mine has written and released a guide on working in film and television production, something he's an expert in.

I thought readers of my blog might appreciate [the book](https://www.wchandler.co) if they or people they knew aspired to work in film production (it's a great and personal read, even for me, an old man without film and TV aspirations), but also, they'd enjoy this excerpt about what technology you should own and be proficient in before you start as a production assistant.

> “Seriously, people will look at you like you have three heads as you drag that eighty-pound hunk of plastic with the extended numerical keyboard from your bag and plop it on the desk.”

If you, or someone you know, wants a start in the film and TV production industry Will's [the book](https://www.wchandler.co) is a must-purchase and must-read - and it's now on [Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C1TPXCJN).
