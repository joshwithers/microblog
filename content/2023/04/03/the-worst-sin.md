The worst sin committed by the news media, today is using [synecdoches](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synecdoche), helping simplify stories, fitting complex stories into headlines or a tweet whilst not representative of reality. People act, not synecdoches. Donâ€™t dehumanise people, reducing their acts to those of the many.

Complex stories deserve gestation time, time for us to understand an comprehend them.
