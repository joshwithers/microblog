I've been reminiscing over Twitter this week, wondering [what the last tweet will be](https://twitter.com/JoshuaWithers/status/1604356662042705920?s=20) amongst other things as Space Karen [prepares to take away the verification tick on my profile](https://twitter.com/verified/status/1648764138452299778) that proves I am who I am, a tick gifted to me from my time in the media in Australia.

I started my [current Twitter account in October 2009](https://twitter.com/joshuawithers) but I was sure that I had an account before then so I went searching and searching and searching and found it: [March 2008, @1073brekky](https://twitter.com/1073brekky).

In 2008 I scored my first paid breakfast radio gig: the morning show on 107.3 FM on the Gold Coast (at the time called 1073fm but now called Juice FM). I'd been training and prepping for this role for five years and was so keen. I was also a bread-and-butter kind of computer nerd, so ideally my non-nerdy radio show would have some nerdy elements. In 2008 the breakfast guy didn't get access to the website - they probably still don't today - so I wanted to find a way to post short updates to the website. Something inside of me felt like the internet might be a thing one day so it would be good to use it early. I've got so many stories about being the nerdiest and most future-thinking guy in the radio station that it broke my heart so many times to be honest.

I had heard things about this service in the USA called Twitter that had heralded a new kind of web publishing, micro-blogging. You could send updates to the service and they could appear in a website widget. I [signed up](https://twitter.com/1073brekky), got the code to the web developer and before you know it, I could post updates to my show website! I didn't care so much for the Tweeting, the replying, or the broadcasting. I just wanted to blog on my radio station website and the CRM didn't allow blogging or micro-blogging or anything of the like.

Twitter solved my problem and I'm sure my problem was never in any of their minimum-viable product meetings.

About two months later I quit the station because at the time it was honestly a terrible place a human with a soul could want to work, but fifteen years on I only have good memories from my first breakfast show, my first Twitter account, and my experiences being unleashed on the Gold Coast community on the radio.
