I was a media and news man for over a decade, I loved being - what I considered to be - an important part of the community, telling its stories and keeping the community informed, safe, and entertained.

But the industry isn't doing well.

The [second story on news.com.au](https://www.news.com.au/finance/money/costs/absolutely-insane-young-couples-shocking-story-of-being-nearly-15-million-in-debt-goes-viral/news-story/8631ce792b5102f70e6f8581837d963c) today is about a [Fox News story](https://www.foxnews.com/media/young-couples-shocking-story-being-nearly-1-million-debt-goes-viral-absolutely-insane) about a recent TikTok that went viral, which the newsdesk found out about through a Twitter user [sharing the TikTok](https://twitter.com/sportynory/status/1645918001651421184) in three parts, and the TikTok was just a replay of a [Youtube clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMk7CKwJ8OM) from a radio show four years ago.

Serendipitously the original clip and radio show was broadcast about one kilometre from where I type this in Franklin, Tennessee, but there's no good reason for Australia's national news website - news.com.au - to publish this as a second story today. That the second most important story in Australia today is a four year old viral video is an insult to the wealth of stories Australia has to tell, and the global stories it could engage with.

Yes, it gets the clicks. Yes, it's actually an important story inside the video, be debt free. But from a professional storytelling point of view it's embarrassing for the news.com.au staff. Even the actual article is poorly written and just lazy.

This is the downfall of society, our storytellers are poorly incentivised to do good work, and over incentivised to do work that gets clicks that advertisers want even though no-one is clicking the ads.
