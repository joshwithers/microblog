Sitting in a Starbucks in Kona just now and a family of four Brits fresh off the Quantum of the Seas cruise ship which just arrived in town. That's the ship that lost a passenger overboard 1400km south of here.
Apparently the person's nickname/codename onboard the ship is "Old Mate".
I guess this is what it feels like to be a minority.
