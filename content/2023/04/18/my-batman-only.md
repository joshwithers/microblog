I have a theory: today in 2023, we have a Batman because terrorists flew airplanes into the World Trade Centre towers in New York City, a.k.a Gotham City.

My premise is that timing of My Chemical  Romance’s Welcome To The Black Parade’s release influenced Robert Pattison’s Batman at an influential age and made him the Bruce Wayne portrayed in the 2022 film, The Batman.

The 2022 Batman was born in 1991 or 1992, making him “[about 30](https://screenrant.com/the-batman-how-old-is-robert-pattinsons-bruce-wayne/)” when the movie was released.

[The Batman’s parents died in 2001](https://screenrant.com/the-batman-wayne-parents-murder-killer-identity-explained/) (possibly 2002), the year that terrorists flew into the World Trade Towers and changed the world forever. One such change being that [Gerard Way formed the band My Chemical Romance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Chemical_Romance#History) in response to the attacks. The other obvious infliction point here is that the death of Thomas and Martha Wayne is the motivation for young Bruce to become Vengeance personified.

In 2006 when The Batman was about 15 or 16 ‘[Welcome To The Black Parade](https://youtu.be/RRKJiM9Njr8)’ was released. Bruce is still rattled by his parent’s murders, growing up a young boy trying to figure out who he is and what his purpose is.

[Your teenage years and the music you listen to through those years are formative](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/12/17003076/spotify-data-shows-songs-teens-adult-taste-music) to who you are and the music you love.

Look at some of My Chemical Romance’s lyrics from the Black Parade:

> When I was a young boy,
> My father took me into the city,
> To see a marching band.
> He said, "Son, when you grow up,
> Would you be the savior of the broken,
> The beaten and the damned?"
> He said, "Will you defeat them?
> Your demons, and all the non-believers,
> The plans that they have made?"
> "Because one day, I'll leave you a phantom...

Cut to 2022 in film, The Batman

> “They think I am hiding in the shadows, but I am the shadows.”

Bruce Wayne is the Batman we know in 2022 because of 9/11.
