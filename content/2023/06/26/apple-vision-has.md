Tim Cook once said that "we are high on AR for the long run" and it's true, for 28 years Apple - and the rest of the tech industry - has been noodling around on augmented reality and virtual reality.

Out of a purely personal interest, I started flipping through rumours about Apple and its "glasses" to see where the leakers got it right and wrong, and the next minute I'm back in 1995, so I thought a curated list of all the leaks, rumours, and related dates might be a nice record to make in the year of our headset, AVP 0.

Enjoy this trip down memory lane:

**1981** - [Steve Mann designs a backpack-mounted computer to control photographic equipment](https://www.media.mit.edu/wearables/lizzy/timeline.html#1981b)

> While still in high-school Steve Mann wired a 6502 computer (*as used in the Apple-II*) into a steel-frame backpack to control flash-bulbs, cameras, and other photographic systems.

**23 May, 1995** - Apple Technical Report #125: [Volumetric Hyper Reality, A Computer Graphics Holy Grail for the 21st Century?](https://web.archive.org/web/19980123213614/http://www.research.apple.com/technology/reports/TR125/TR125.html)

> Such a display would convincingly create the illusion of objects with arbitrary optical properties. A metallic object depicted using the display would reflect the visual surroundings of the display. Dielectric materials would show correct refraction and reflection effects. Light shone on the display would illuminate the virtual objects within it. When programmed to depict empty space, the display would, for all practical purposes, disappear, rendering the contained volume invisible. Incremental steps towards such a device are discussed.

**1996** - [Apple demonstrates a prototype wearable computer system from Apple Computer with a Virtual I/O head-mounted display at the seventh Stereoscopic Displays and Applications conference](http://www.stereoscopic.org/1996/preface.html)

**September 16, 1997** - Steve Jobs returns to Apple

**March, 1998** - Tim Cook joins Apple as senior vice president for worldwide operations

**March 21, 2002** - [Apple: Stereoscopic Displays?](https://www.macrumors.com/2002/03/21/apple-stereoscopic-displays/)

> Apple is said to have other flat-panel technologies cooking in the labs, including stereoscopic displays

Arnold Kim writes:
> Stereoscopic displays would presumably simulate 3d/VR environments. A bit unique for the consumer market... but an interesting area of research for Apple.

**May 16, 2003** - [Simon Greenwold publishes his Spatial Computing masters thesis](https://acg.media.mit.edu/people/simong/)

**June 29, 2007** - Apple releases the iPhone

**April 17, 2008** - [Apple Researching Laser-Based Head Mounted Display](https://www.macrumors.com/2008/04/17/apple-researching-laser-based-head-mounted-display/)

> A user simply plugs their handheld video player such as the iPod manufactured by Apple Computer of Cupertino, Calif., into the compact laser engine attached to their belt, and places the headset on their head. The user then selects a video to be played at the handheld video player (viewing through transparent display elements).

> The invention covers a 3D display environment for a mobile device that uses orientation data from one or more onboard sensors to automatically determine and display a perspective projection of the 3D display environment based on the orientation data without the user physically interacting with (e.g., touching) the display.

**August 2012** - [Palmer Luckey launches the Oculus campaign on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1523379957/oculus-rift-step-into-the-game/description)

**26 February, 2013** - [John Gruber on Google Glass](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/02/26/topolsky-glass):

> And the idea that people will wear things like this everywhere (as opposed to special specific scenarios, such as workers in an environment where their hands are otherwise occupied, like, say, surgeons) strikes me as creepy as hell.

**December 10, 2013** - [Apple's Work on Video Goggles Highlighted in Newly Granted Patent](https://www.macrumors.com/2013/12/10/apples-work-on-video-goggles-highlighted-in-newly-granted-patent/)

> A goggle system for providing a personal media viewing experience to a user is provided. The goggle system may include an outer cover, a mid-frame, optical components for generating the media display, and a lens on which the generated media displayed is provided to the user. The goggle system, or head-mounted display may have any suitable appearance. For example, the goggle system may resemble ski or motorcycle goggles. To enhance the user's comfort, the goggle system may include breathable components, including for example breathable foam that rests against the user's face, and may allow the user to move the display generation components for alignment with the user's eyes. In some embodiments, the goggle system may include data processing circuitry operative to adjust left and right images generated by the optical components to display 3-D media, or account for a user's eyesight limitations.

> The patent notes that visual-based inertial navigation systems can achieve positional awareness down to the centimetre scale without the need for GPS or cellular network signals. However, the technology is unsuitable for implementation in typical mobile devices because of the processing demands involved in variable real-time location tracking.

> To overcome the limitation, Apple's invention uses something called a sliding window inverse filter (SWF) that minimizes computational load by using predictive coding to map the orientation of objects relative to the device.

> He then went on to co-found Keyhole, the company that later got acquired by Google to become the foundation of Google Maps. After a brief stint at Linden Lab, Bar-Zeev worked for four years at Microsoft.

> “He helped found and invent Hololens at Microsoft, assembling the very first AR prototypes, demos and UX concepts, sufficient to convince his leadership,” according to his LinkedIn bio.

Avi says:
> “I left my full-time position at Apple in January. I had the best exit one can imagine. I have only nice things to say about Apple and won’t comment on any specific product plans.”

> Apple executives discussed the timelines, which haven't been previously reported, in an internal presentation to employees at the company's Cupertino, California, campus in October, according to people familiar with the matter. Apple Vice President Mike Rockwell, who heads the team responsible for Apple's AR and virtual reality initiatives, led the meeting, which included new details about the design and features of the AR headset, these people said. The product timetables run counter to recent analyst and media reports that said an Apple AR device could arrive as early as next year.
