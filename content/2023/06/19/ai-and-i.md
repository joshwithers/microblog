About three hours ago I was putting my daughter to bed and thought it would be cute to have ChatGPT write a fairytale about Luna and where we're staying this week, Liechtenstein.

I thought it was a cute story and something others might enjoy.

Three hours later I've had Midjourney make illustrations, assembled the book - very roughly - in the 'Kindle Kids Book Creator', and it's now submitted to the Amazon Kindle store.

You can see the ChatGPT prompts [here](https://chat.openai.com/share/902065ad-1c78-4505-8df5-bb88f3c6bfeb) and download [the .mobi file here](https://let.josh.show/The-Mountain-Princess). When it's live on the Kindle store I believe [this link](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=B0C8L6LPYP) will get you there.

Three hours from a good idea to a low-fi book being published.
