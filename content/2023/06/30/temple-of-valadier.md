Over 1000 years old, this sanctuary in Genga's Frasassi Caves was intended to be a refuge from sinners, but when you see it from a sky, it looks like the church itself is seeking refuge from the world.

The temple you now see was complete in 1827 under the suggestion of Pope Leo XII. For all this time it was called the Temple of Valadier but recent study has revealed that Giuseppe Valadier, its namesake architect, didn't design it at all.

Either which way, it's nice to know that Catholic sinners get a cool place to pilgrimage to.

I caught a few moments after the sun set, in between rain clouds, to get the drone up. I'd been driving for 45 minutes and gotten stuck down two dead ends. I was making these photos tonight!
