From the University of Berkshire Hathaway by Daniel Pecaut, Corey Wrenn:

> Buffett also shared some of his classic bits of wisdom about growing wealth. Spend less than what you make. Know and stay within your circle of competence. The only businesses that matter are the ones you put your money in. Keep learning over time. Donâ€™t lose. Insist on a margin of safety.
