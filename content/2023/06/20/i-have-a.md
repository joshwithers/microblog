I have a confession to make.

I didn't know "[The Alps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps)" were a thing. I thought people referred to "the alps" when they referred to alpine areas.

This probably explains why I nerded out pretty hard when I got to the Alps and kept on typing the alps and all my computing devices would autocorrect to The Alps.

Anyway, here's a 360 photo of a part of the Alps from Kufstein in Austria.

And another from Lake Wolfgang
