The lead singer responsible for bringing this century its greatest motivational pop/ska punk/power pop song, All Star, has passed away.

[Pitchfork](https://pitchfork.com/news/smash-mouth-frontman-steve-harwell-dies-at-56/):

> Steve Harwell, the founding singer of Smash Mouth, died today at his home in Boise, Idaho, of liver failure, The New York Times reports. The musician was 56 years old. Harwell dealt with alcoholism and numerous health issues in the years preceding his death. 

Smash Mouth undeniably left a dent on pop culture from 1999 onwards, and when I saw the band perform in November 2018 it was stale performance from a tired Steve with a team of young local musos behind him, yet the songs struck that joyful chord in my born-in-1981 heart.

But I want to leave you with Steve’s 2003 cover of Neil Diamond’s You Are My Number One.

> Hold me down
> I'm gonna fly straight to heaven
> Hold me down
> Dont ever let go
> I've been around
> You know I can't stay forever
> And when I leave
> I want you to know -
> When I'm finally gone, I'm gonna be gone without a trace
> There's a lot of good times ahead before we're done

As someone commented on X, with Jimmy Buffet passing it’s not a great week for guys who liked to party, but it seems like Steve was self-aware enough to know that all of our days are numbered.

I just hope the girl with the shape of an L on her forehead had nothing to do with this.
