About 20 years ago, somewhere early 2003 from memory, I learned the most important lesson I'd ever been taught in broadcasting and business, from Stan Hillard:

> (When you're broadcasting) imagine the audience are the stupidest people alive, but treat them with the upmost respect.

It's an axiom employee daily. Assuming the audience doesn't know the backstory, they don't know your reasoning or motivation, or they simply haven't been listening. It's about inclusivity, with the upmost respect for them.

On a side note, in trying to find where Stan was at today, [I stumbled across this piece I wrote for Radio Today ten years ago](https://radiotoday.com.au/community-radio-should-be-cut-off/). Looking back it feels rude at the time but still true today.
