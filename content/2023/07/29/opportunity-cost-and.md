Leaving Puglia today and Iâ€™m struck by the thought, after having experienced about thirty different international communities and societies over the last year that there is an opportunity cost to every society.

I've left every community thinking "this was great, but ..." identifying trade-offs and compromises made to build that society.

Like Puglia for example, I love it here, but there's no breakfast culture. In fact most of the world doesn't celebrate breakfast like Australians do, and weirdly enough that's possibly important to me.

Perhaps utopia is impossible because it would simply be the longest list of compromises ever made? Perhaps getting a good breakfast means you have to live in a society where everyone bottles their feelings and pretends to be polite in traffic, as opposed to Italy where you find out how the driver feels straight away but they won't road rage you?

Is that the price I want to pay for eggs Benedict and a long black with cream?
