One of my great loves in this world is the format and medium of audio storytelling. First radio, then podcasting, it's one of the most beautiful ways to tell a story.

So it's pretty cool to [wish the modern medium of podcasting a 20th birthday this weekend](https://podnews.net/update/podcast-20th-birthday-history). Thank you to [@podnews](https://micro.blog/podnews) for the writeup.
