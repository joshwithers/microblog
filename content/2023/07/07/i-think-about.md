I think about the Malcolm Gladwell book ‘Talking to Strangers’ every day

> We think we can easily see into the hearts of others based on the flimsiest of clues. We jump at the chance to judge strangers. We would never do that to ourselves, of course. We are nuanced and complex and enigmatic. But the stranger is easy.

Today I’m thinking about it in context to Threads by Instagram and how the hot takes are flying about how it’s absolutely  going to succeed or absolutely going to fail.

Make room for the nuanced, complex, enigmas.
