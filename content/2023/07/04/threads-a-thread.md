ðŸ§µ Decentralisocial networks are cool, but you know whatâ€™s also cool? Talking to your existing friends group, and having your content enjoyed by people.

Unlike most of my late-2022 and 2023 content which hasnâ€™t been seen by more than 10 to 15 eyes.

Prediction: Threads will win; T2, Bluesky, the others will falter; ActivityPub and Mastodon will be a fun place for niche communities.
