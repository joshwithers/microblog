Does anyone else have weird iPhone storage glitches? I've had this problem for the last maybe 4-5 years where my iPhone doesn't actually know how much storage it has. I've been on a 256GB iPhone for a while now, and Apple Store staff have asked me to backup and restore, I've even started on new installs recently.

The only thing that normally fixes it is doing a backup to my Mac.

My gut feeling tells me that there was a time maybe 4-5 years ago where I was loading in RAW images from my camera into iCloud Photo Library and editing with RAW Power and I reckon that they're stuck in the iCloud/phone storage jungle.

My Mac's Photos library also has this weird thing where it picks 1 or 2 photos that it allegedly cannot upload to the cloud, yet it actually originally got that photo from the cloud (it was uploaded on my phone), and the photo is still in the cloud.

I'm semi-tempted to burn this 20-year-old .mac/MobileMe/iCloud account to the ground, export everything, and start again. It feels like there's always something small that could be buggy happening ... or is that just how iCloud feels for everyone?
