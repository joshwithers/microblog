The most fascinating, whilst also overwhelming, experience in travel, especially when you undertake it for more than a weekend is 'noticing'. 

Almost every time I notice something I think about what Steve Jobs once said:

> "When you are a stranger in a place, you notice things that you rapidly stop noticing when you become familiar."

I sincerely love being a stranger. I think that's a common thread in my life, that when I become too known I feel uncomfortable. I feel very comfortable being a stranger in a strange place and rather too uncomfortable being at home.

I hope I can give my kids the upbringing that would help them feel the complete opposite, but still curious about the world, still desiring to be strangers in a strange place, noticing.
