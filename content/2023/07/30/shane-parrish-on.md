Shane Parrish on fs.blog with, [Hanlonâ€™s Razor: Not Everyone is Out to Get You](https://fs.blog/mental-model-hanlons-razor/), is such an encouraging read today. I was only thinking about how we more often than not think that everyone is looking at us as I was on a beach in Puglia yesterday considering very quickly stripping out of my swimmers into dry pants. I almost did until Britt suggested that everyone would see me. I still wonder whether they would have, and I think not. Most people don't notice me, don't see me, and don't know me. Even less read this blog.

What is Hanlon's Razor you may ask?

> Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by neglect.

The fs.blog article stretches the razor out to some real world artefacts: 

The media:

> Modern media treats outrage as a profitable commodity. This often takes the form of articles which often attribute to malice that which could be easily be explained by incompetence or ignorance.

Not everyone is out to get you.
