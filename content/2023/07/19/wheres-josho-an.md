Just going on the record for everyone who asks where we are, where we‚Äôre living now, and if we‚Äôre ever coming home to Australia: we‚Äôre in Italy then Paris and Singapore between now and getting home to the Gold Coast late August.

I‚Äôm back to work and at your service making weddings and elopements from August 22, 2023.

I‚Äôve got travel around Australia and New Zealand for weddings and elopements through the end of this year and early next year before we head back to Europe in 2024.

I‚Äôve also had some requests for the USA if you‚Äôre interested in having me there too.

June, July, and August 2024 for [weddings](https://withers.co/celebrant) and also elopements with [The Elopement Collective](https://withers.co/elopementcollective) and some of our team including [Jason Corroto](https://www.jasoncorrotophoto.com), [House of Love Weddings](https://houseofloveweddings.com), [George Bowden](https://www.georgebowden.co), [House Of Lucie](https://www.houseoflucie.com), and [Pearce Brennan](https://pearcebrennan.co).

Finally, I wanted to address something a few people have lovingly brought to my attention ‚ÄúI thought you only did elopements‚Äù.

I might be married to the @elopementcollective‚Äôs boss, but I create ceremony for all and sundry. Big weddings, small weddings, elopements, and corporate events as a master of ceremonies. As the band was named, I do weddings, parties, anything.

So very formerly: I do weddings as well. If you know someone getting married somewhere in the world and you reckon we‚Äôd be a fit, let them know I exist!
