Update on the book writing: I wrote a lot and I thought it was ok, I ran it past some friends and it wasn't as good as I thought, and on further reflection it was worse.

Then I read this in Stephen King's On Writing:

> If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot.

So I'm currently reading a lot. I used to read a bit, now I'm reading a lot.
