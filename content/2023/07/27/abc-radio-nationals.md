ABC Radio National's Andrew West interviewing Ian Buruma on in [The religious and spiritual ethics of wokeness](https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/religionandethicsreport/ian-buruma-and-the-spirit-of-woke/102643222):

> It's when a movement to improve certain social conditions, whether it's about race, gender, or whatever else, turns from an active effort into a rigid ideology, then you have a problem.

Ian originally wrote about wokeness in [Harpers Magazine](https://harpers.org/archive/2023/07/protestant-ethic-and-the-spirit-of-wokeness/):

> Writing about “Woke” has at least two pitfalls. One is that any criticism of its excesses provokes accusations of racism, xenophobia, transphobia, misogyny, or white supremacy. The other problem is the word itself, which has been a term of abuse employed by the far right, a battle cry for the progressive left, and an embarrassment to many liberals.

Looking forward to a future where being woke is a clearer idea and status. I'm sick of wondering if I'm a sheeple or a wolk folk, and by who's definition.
