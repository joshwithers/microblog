[Matt Mullenweg on Apple and 1.0 products back in 2010](https://ma.tt/2010/11/one-point-oh/):

> Many entrepreneurs idolize Steve Jobs. He’s such a perfectionist, they say. Nothing leaves the doors of 1 Infinite Loop in Cupertino without a polish and finish that makes geeks everywhere drool. No compromise!
> I like Apple for the opposite reason: they’re not afraid of getting a rudimentary 1.0 out into the world.
