The deeper I traverse into life on Planet Earth, into fatherhood, business, weddings, photography, and friendship I am ever further interested in art, making art, and making great art. 

So Matt Ruby's deviation from his normal comedic quick wit and observation [Substack](https://mattruby.substack.com) into this interesting read on George Michael, his coming out, connecting Freedom with Wham and his later Freedom '90, captured all of my attention today.

[This whole read was just really interesting](https://mattruby.substack.com/p/what-george-michaels-greatest-song).

Sometimes the clothes, indeed, do not make the man

<p>Michael couldn’t handle the combo of massive success and mockery. He did everything he could to make us love him, yet we still didn’t respect him. He wanted us to admire his mind, but we just wanted to stare at his butt. And that set the table for his cri de coeur: “Freedom ’90.”&nbsp;</p>
