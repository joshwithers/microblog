Reed Albergotti in [Semafor Technology](https://www.semafor.com/newsletter/07/26/2023/openais-rivals-can-give-customers-something-it-cant-flexibility):

> Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and the navigation company TomTom [released](https://overturemaps.org/download/) a free mapping dataset in a bid to compete with Google Maps and Apple Maps. Developers can use the data, which includes 59 million places of interest, to create their own navigation products.

If a powerfully simple mapping system like What3Words can't gain traction in a decade, I don't think TomTom can get a foot up by giving it away.

I am curious where this leaves Bing Maps though.
