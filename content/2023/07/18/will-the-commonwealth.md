Will the 2026 Commonwealth Games, [originally supposed to be in Victoria, Australia](https://slate.com/culture/2016/08/the-olymics-should-be-in-vancouver-summer-and-winter-forever.html), be the first ones to test the "Vancouver should be the permanent Olympic Games city" that [Jonathan Fischer reignited seven years ago in Slate](https://slate.com/culture/2016/08/the-olymics-should-be-in-vancouver-summer-and-winter-forever.html), of course but for the Olympic's little sibling, the Comm' Games:

> That’s why the Olympics should relocate to a city that won’t just relieve the rest of the world of hosting duties for the Summer Games but of the Winter Games, too. It would have to be a place with the right climate. It would have to be a place that could afford it. It should possess something of an international flavour. It should have a proven track record. It should be located in a democratic country but not a hegemonic one. It should be Vancouver.
