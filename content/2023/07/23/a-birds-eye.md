A birds eye view of Martina Franca, in southern Puglia, where we've been hanging out this month.

<img src="uploads/2023/dji-0261.jpg" width="600" height="449" alt="">

In these photos, happening at the same time, is a funeral procession, a dance contest, and an opera, amongst whatever else the 49,000 residents are getting up to.

There's also [two 360 photos of Martina Franca in this embed](https://panoraven.com/en/embed/nQMKHcLdz7), a higher and lower shot, look for the hotspots when you're scrolling around.
