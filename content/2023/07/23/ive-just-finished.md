I've just [finished](https://joshwithers.blog/finished-reading/) reading [Burn-In: A Novel of the Real Robotic Revolution](https://micro.blog/books/9781328637239) by P. W. Singer, recommended by my favourite Cybersecurity Guard, [@qldnick](https://micro.blog/qldnick) ðŸ“š

It was a compelling and enjoyable read, and honestly, a refreshingly human conclusion that somewhat settles its disturbing and frightening chorus of a society a few years ahead of where we are today struggling with the effects of advancing technology.

The largest truth in this fictional read is that fear always takes the wheel, especially for those who have apparently been listening to the guy who said not to fear.
