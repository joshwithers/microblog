We've been in more Airbnb's this last year than most people, about 35 so far I think. Most hosts mention either in person, or in their review, how it's unique to travel with our kids (four and two) and how we don't ask much of them, like how this host mentioned out "autonomy".

Should we be more needy? Are we too Australian? Honestly, after driving three to five hours with kids the last thing we want to do is talk to an Airbnb host lol.
