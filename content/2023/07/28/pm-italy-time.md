11:27pm Italy time and I've been slogging away for hours at the stupidest CSS thing that changed in the most recent version of the Shopify code. Felt good to feel like it was 1999 and I was a web developer again.

Any how, [sugargathered.com](https://sugargathered.com) is now open for business on Shopify, I've just spent the last (far too many months) amount of time [moving it from Squarespace](https://old.sugargathered.com) and implementing lots of cool things for my friends who run it.

If you want some donuts delivered to, or at an event on, the Gold Coast, I can recommend a great website.
