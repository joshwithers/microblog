One of my most-used and favourite apps is Flighty, and they've just [announced a new version](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1358823008) that's basically a frequent flyer's private social network. I love it!

> Flighty 3.0 is the new way to share your flying with family and friends. Keep track of your loved ones, not flight numbers. Another industry-first from Flighty.
> 1. Flighty Friends - Connect with family and friends once, then you can see each other trips and get alerts — automatically and ongoing. You’ll see them on your map, can choose alerts levels, and can stop sharing anytime.
> 2. Group Trip Ready - Your flights and friend’s flights appear together in the new Today view. Everyone’s live ETA and status make group trips easy.
> 3. Friends Names in Flight Alerts - Now with name, photo, and custom controls per person to avoid notification fatigue.
> 4. Trip Sharing - Send multiple flights at once. Receivers can add them to Flighty, or simply view them in their browser.
> 5. Whose Flight is That? - See who’s on each flight in your flight list, on the map, and including their seat number if you’re sharing a plane.

Add me as a friend on Flighty, yo!

P.S.: Flighty is one of the very few iPhone apps I use on the regular which was quick to allow it's app to be used on Apple silicon Macs, something more developers should consider enabling.
