ðŸ“š After [backing](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/renai/the-frustrated-state) and reading Renai Le Mayâ€™s [The Frustrated State](https://micro.blog/books/978064825950) it felt like Australian governments had completed, achieved the highest level of information technology incompetence. COVID proved me so very wrong, but then [today Anthony Agius writes in The Sizzle](https://share.thesizzle.com.au/devs-can-kinda-order-apple-vision-pro-kits-spotify-increases-pricing-centrelink-calculator-project-cancelled.html):

> Services Australia has cancelled a project to create a calculator for Centrelink entitlements, after spending $191m on it over 3 years. Incredible incompetency for such a basic thing the government needs.

How many millions of dollars can the Australian government flush until we actually get real upset?
