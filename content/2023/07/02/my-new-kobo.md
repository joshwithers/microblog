ðŸ“š I've owned and used a Kindle for over a decade, it had been my favourite gadget for so long. But over the years I started to realise that Amazon wasn't interested in pushing the platform forward any further and the software wasn't going to get any better. I even upgraded to the Amazon Kindle Scribe and it was an embarrassingly bad product. The final straw was when Jean-Louis GassÃ©e's new book, [Grateful Geek](https://micro.blog/books/9798987047446) just didn't work on any physical Kindle devices, despite Amazon happily selling me a copy.

On the [ATP](https://atp.fm) Marco Arment started expressing similar concerns a few weeks/months earlier in 2023 and he did the hard testing and returning work required to convince me to buy a Kobo Libra 2 while I was in Paris in May.

I love this device, it's my new favourite gadget. But ...

- The Kobo store is in a dismal state, and/or, the publishing world is in a dismal state
- The eBook publishing world is run by terrible humans who sometimes charge more for an eBook than a printed book, often release the print book weeks or months before an ebook, and just generally don't know how to sell a book to people.
- There isn't a competing ebook marketplace outside of Amazon and Kobo.
- And there's a chance that the other great feature of Kobo eReaders is going away in [Pocket integration](https://www.theverge.com/23778208/kobo-pocket-ebook-reader-integration-ending), that is, unless Kobo updates its software.

So I'm now left in a weird spot, there are five books I'd like to read and buy, but I can't buy them for my Kobo. Will anyone sell me a plain old boring ePub?

The [enshitiffication](https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/) of the world continues and I guess those books will just sit on [my electronic bookshelf](https://joshwithers.blog/bookshelf/) waiting for me to figure out how to read them without cutting down another tree or having two ereaders.
