I shared this on Facebook six years ago, on July 24, 2017:

> Something you probably don't realise when you ask me to be your celebrant is that in celebrating your marriage, you're gleaning a little from mine.
> As I prep for your ceremony I'm taking notes on you both and your definitions of marriage,m although the foundation of my belief of what marriage is and what it looks like in real life starts at home.
> So with that said, I ought share some personal news about our marriage.
> For almost five years Britt and I have been trying to fall pregnant, so today we took the next step and our doctor extracted 13 eggs from Britt so we could get some third party assistance in that area.

> How cute is it that while you're under general anaesthetic they scribble the extraction number on your hand like you're tattooing your BFF with a biro in high school.
> Life doesn't always go as you plan, that's the beauty of marriage - it's the two of you together forever regardless of how well the plan's going, or not. And because of that union, we know, that the best is yet to come.

Hereâ€™s an update on those thirteen eggs today.
