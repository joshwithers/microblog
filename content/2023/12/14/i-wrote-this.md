I wrote this [eight years ago on Facebook](https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2023/64e5580ec0.jpg). I think itâ€™s more valid today plus I want to preserve it on my blog:

> With all of our books, albums, magazines, and letters going digital and stored outside of the physical and easily visible realm, how will our kids discover that album that dad loved, or that magazine that mum kept? 

> I remember that "already in our house from mum and dad" discovery being a big thing for me.

> I love Led Zeppelin and Sheryl Crow because I found the album at home. I loved Nick Earl's ZigZag Street because it was sitting on a shelf in a room I was renting on the Gold Coast when I first worked for Sea FM. I discovered albums I still love because they were sitting on the music director's desk and they weren't on demo enough to give away on air. I love Smith Journal, Monocle, and Relevant Magazine because I found them on shelves, tables, coffee shops, before I ever bought them.

> How will our kids discover things?

> Will they rely purely on people recommending things? 

> Recommending culture is hard. I barely ever show other people music I like because a) I don't want them not liking it to affect my liking it, and b) it's kind of rude to assume that anyone would like anything.

> Passive discovery has been such a strong driving force for hundreds of years, surely that hasn't been replaced with trending topics, Facebook shares, and retweets?
