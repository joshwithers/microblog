Just discovered my favourite parable:

> A businessman is sitting on the beach of a small fishing village when he sees a fisherman approach the shore with his daily haul. Impressed by the quality of the fish, the businessman asks the fisherman how long it took him to bring in his catch.

> “Just a short while,” the fisherman replies.

> “Why don’t you stay out longer to catch more fish?” the businessman asks.

> “Because this is all I need.”

> “But then what do you do with your time?”

> “I sleep late, catch a few fish, play with my kids, take a nap with my wife, and then join my buddies in town to drink wine and play guitar,” the fisherman responds.

> The businessman is shocked. He explains that he has an MBA, and that if the fisherman follows his advice, he could help him grow his business. “You could buy a bigger boat,” the businessman says, “and use the proceeds to open your own cannery.”

> “Then what?” the fisherman asks.

> “You could move to the city to open a distribution center.”

> “And then what?”

> “You could expand your business internationally and eventually take your company public,” the businessman says. “When the time is right, you could sell your shares and become very rich.”

> “And then what?”

> “Well, then you can retire, move to a small fishing village, sleep late, catch a few fish, play with your kids, take naps with your wife, and join your buddies in town to drink wine and play guitar.”

> The fisherman smiles at the businessman and continues down the beach.
