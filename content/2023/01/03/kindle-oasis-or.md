My second Amazon Kindle is a Kindle I've owned since late 2016, my first generation Kindle Oasis. It's been a solid travel companion but after six years its battery barely lasts a day and I'm hot for something new. I've been waiting for a 2022/2023 release of a new Oasis and when the Scribe was released I started thinking this might not occur.

So while I was in native Amazon territory where deliveries are quick and returns are easily done at Whole Foods, I thought I'd buy both - the latest Kindle Oasis and the new Kindle Scribe - and return the one I liked the least.
