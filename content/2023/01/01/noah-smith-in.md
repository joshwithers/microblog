[Noah Smith in The internet wants to be fragmented](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/the-internet-wants-to-be-fragmented):

> "Perhaps someday the human race will be ready to become one collective consciousness. But the experiment of the 2010s shows that this day is not today. Let the internet once more be an escape â€” a place where you can find your people and be happy. Let us learn to speak a thousand different languages once again. Let the Tower of Babel fall."
