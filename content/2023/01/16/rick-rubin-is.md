Rick Rubin is the guest on [episode 649](https://tim.blog/2023/01/12/rick-rubin-2/) of the Tim Ferris show and this is one of those podcasts you really want to listen to.

> "Look for what you notice that no-one else sees."

Robert Henri's quote is quoted and man, this is sitting with me all day every day:

> "The object isn't to make art, it's to be in that wonderful state that makes art inevitable"

This is a good listen.
