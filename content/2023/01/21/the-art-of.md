ðŸ“š [The Art of Growing Up](https://micro.blog/books/9781760556723) by John Marsden:

> "A friend of mine told the story of driving along a country road one day with her little son, when he remarked: â€˜Look at the beautiful tree, Mummy.â€™ She replied: â€˜Yes, itâ€™s a manna gum.â€™ There was a long silence from the back seat, broken at last by her child asking: â€˜So is there a name for everything, then?â€™"
