Judging by the [many](https://tim.blog/2023/01/12/rick-rubin-2/) different [recordings](https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/rick-rubin/) I'm hearing and also seeing pop up on the web of Rick Rubin doing the circuit to promote his new ðŸ“š book, [The Creative Act](https://micro.blog/books/9780593652886), he's much better in conversation than the written word. I'm reading the book and I'm struggling to stay tuned in.
