[A few days ago I](https://joshwithers.blog/2023/01/03/kindle-oasis-or.html) ordered a latest generation Kindle Oasis and a new Kindle Scribe with the intention of only keeping one to replace my six year old Kindle Oasis who’s battery barely lasted a day.

Today a UPS driver picks one up to take it back home to Bezos, and I’m keeping the Kindle Scribe.

Why?

Kindle Scribe Pros:
- Nice and big
- USB-C charging
- notepad and pencil input for note taking and signing paperwork
- so big
- all the Remarkable 2 you want with the benefit of all the Kindle you want
- new fancy product

Kindle Scribe Cons:
- so very big
- no buttons
- too big
- a little heavy
- Kindle OS is still crappy and salesy
- new product, 1.0 version sadness
