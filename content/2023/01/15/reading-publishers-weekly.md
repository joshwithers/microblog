Reading [*Publishers Weekly* top twenty-five bestseller list](https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/bookselling/article/91256-colleen-hoover-was-queen-of-2022-s-bestseller-list.html?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) is something I'm finding depressing, not because of the content of the list, but the numbers. So few books are being read. Props to Colleen Hoover, someone I'd never heard of before now, for having eight books on that list, it sounds like romance still sells.
