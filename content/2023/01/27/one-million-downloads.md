Ive always secretly thought that when I reached 1 million downloads on Unsplash I’d stop posting there.

But as I passed the landmark this week I realised that sometimes we set silly goals about silly things.

I still don’t know why I share my art there, but I know I get more messages, emails, and commissioned paid work from Unsplash than I do from any other of my networks or communities.
