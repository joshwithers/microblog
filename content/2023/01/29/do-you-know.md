Do you know the most disappointing thing about the United States of America?

That the entire narrative of and about the country is defined by a small handful of topics recycled so quickly that outsiders often don't even know which Police Officer killing, which mass shooting, which disappointing President, or which sexually abusive old white male you're all angry about this week. It's hard to keep up, and you need new stories. Not new fake stories so the rest of the world thinks you're cool again. You need new truths so the new stories just kinda flow pretty easily.

Or be like Iceland. No-one ever hears about Iceland unless it's a photo of some cool landscape.
