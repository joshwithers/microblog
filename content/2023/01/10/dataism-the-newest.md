[Meghan O’Gieblyn in The Believer posits that AI is a new god](https://www.thebeliever.net/artificial-intelligence-god/?ref=refind), the god of Dataism.

> "Science was supposed to have banished God, but he keeps turning up in our latest technologies. He is the ghost lurking in our data sets, the cockroach hiding beneath the particle accelerator."

Going on to this banger:

> “Just as according to Christianity we humans cannot understand God and His plan, so Dataism declares that the human brain cannot fathom the new master algorithms.”
