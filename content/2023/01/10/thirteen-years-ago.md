Thirteen years ago I read this on Seth Godin’s blog and it’s sat with me every day since:

> “One option is to struggle to be heard whenever you're in the room ... another is to be the sort of person who is missed when you're not. The first involves making noise. The second involves making a difference.”

All I want to in this life is make a difference. Nothing in me wants to make a noise.
