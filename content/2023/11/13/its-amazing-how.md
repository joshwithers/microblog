It's amazing how close Google is to upsetting the iMessage monopoly and I'm betting they'll let go of the opportunity.

I've just started using Google Chat for a new project and it's actually not terrible. For someone in the Apple ecosystem, it's not far from being as good as iMessage.

They need a native Mac app that works like a Mac app, and their iPhone app needs to work in with the share sheet API, but it's close.

They're so busy fighting for iMessage to accept RCS/Google that they'll no doubt miss this opportunity to just put iMessage out of business.
