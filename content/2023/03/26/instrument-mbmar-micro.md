ðŸ“· Instrument (#mbmar Micro Blog March photo challenge prompt suggested by [@UnfocusedWanderlust](https://micro.blog/UnfocusedWanderlust))

On Friday I was photographing [Los Sagrados for their new website](https://lossagrados.org), and a musician came out to perform the flute and percussion for the horses. It was quite a thing to witness.
