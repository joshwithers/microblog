I’ve spent the last week mulling an idea about Apple and AI then [Linus goes and writes a piece](https://open.substack.com/pub/linusekenstam/p/all-eyes-on-apple-whats-their-next?r=ilth&utm_medium=ios&utm_campaign=post) which basically is what I was going to write, with the only addition, to keep an eye on Stability AI and Stable Diffusion. [Apple has made a few small moves](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/stable-diffusion-coreml-apple-silicon) in their direction recently.

My guess is that any Apple LLM/AI move will be under the brand of Siri, albeit an extension or added product to what we know as Siri in early 2023.
