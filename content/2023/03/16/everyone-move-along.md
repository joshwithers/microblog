Everyone move along, there’s nothing to see here.

The “crack” on Josh’s iPhone screen that has occupied his sad mind for the last two hours was actually the smallest dried strand of egg yolk draped across his screen, hard enough and thin enough to seem like a crack to the untrained mind.

If only you could’ve seen the look on my face as I scratched off the scratch like a miracle healer.
