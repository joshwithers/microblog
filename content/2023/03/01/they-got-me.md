They got me by talking about my main domain name and my main domain host. Even though it’s not hosted at VentraIP. I’m just so used to having to correct payments there.

I didn’t even notice the bung I in VentraIP, the bad email address, the bad domain.

I’ve locked the two credit cards I fed them. Feel like an idiot.

As Abe Simpson said, and it will happen to yoouuuuu.
