From [On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft](https://micro.blog/books/9780743455961) by Stephen King ðŸ“š

> "Put your desk in the corner, and every time you sit down there to write, remind yourself why it isnâ€™t in the middle of the room. Life isnâ€™t a support-system for art. Itâ€™s the other way around."
