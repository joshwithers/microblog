I'm feeling bullish on the new group-messaging app and platform, Wavelength, After reading John Gruber's [review](https://daringfireball.net/2023/03/wavelength), then using it and joining a group, I think it could replace group chats in other places, but also serve as a platform for new conversations.

If you're interested, I've started a few group chats:
- [The Frequent Travellers Society](https://wavelength.app/invite/J3lDjVxGF52#ylk9Ujq1CNT1wII1_fXx4A--), because I like to talk about travel.
- [The Celebrant Institute](https://wavelength.app/invite/ITC20A7mdaS#C7Zbj8T8tjAYLucI.Broxg--), you wouldn't believe it but it's for celebrants.
- [The Apple Nation](https://wavelength.app/invite/GvrhjKWiYT6#.j3gf_4KrH5aNcBhyNEZAw--) because I follow Apple like a sport, it's my favourite hobby.
  
Jump onboard if you're interested!
