When Vanilla Ice rapped that he was back with a 'brand new invention', he was indeed 'back' after his first hit, a cover of Play That Funky Music, but was the invention the lyrics (which is kind of the whole idea of a song), his theft of the Under Pressure bass line, or was he talking about the Ninja Rap that came out the next year?
