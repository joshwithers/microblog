The most interesting (to me) new app/social net-ugh-something-work is [Artifact](https://artifact.news/i?code=4SWAAE). It’s from the guys who created Instagram but it’s like a ‘TikTok for articles/blog posts/news.

I personally would much prefer to read than watch a video, so this is my kind of network.
