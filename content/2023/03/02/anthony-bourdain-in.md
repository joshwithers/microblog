Anthony Bourdain in 1999 before he was that chef guy everyone knew, writing ['Don't Eat Before Reading This' in the New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1999/04/19/dont-eat-before-reading-this):

> "Good food, good eating, is all about blood and organs, cruelty and decay. Itâ€™s about sodium-loaded pork fat, stinky triple-cream cheeses, the tender thymus glands and distended livers of young animals."
