Maryanne Wolf [on reading](https://www.abc.net.au/religion/maryanne-wolf-cultivating-deep-reading-in-a-digital-age/102001224):

> Literacy literally changes the human brain. The process of learning to read changes our brain, but so does what we read, how we read and on what we read (print, e-reader, phone, laptop). This is especially important in our new reality, when many people are tethered to multiple screens at any given moment.

She also quotes this which really makes me want to throw the TV in the bin:

> When watching a screen, the infant is bombarded with a stream of fast-paced movements, ongoing blinking lights and scene changes, which require ample cognitive resources to make sense of and process. The brain becomes “overwhelmed” and is unable to leave adequate resources for itself to mature in cognitive skills such as executive functions.
