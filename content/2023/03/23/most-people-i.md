Most people I respect or look up to journal every day but it's not a habit I can get into. Tonight I learned about the simple and powerful 1-1-1 journalling method, and then to get nerdy with it, there's [a tutorial on making a Shortcut](https://hulry.com/apple-notes-templates/) to make it easier. Then follow [this advice from Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-au/guide/shortcuts/apdacfdf1802/ios) on how to run a Shortcut from a Reminder, I prompted Siri to remind me of it every day at 9pm.
