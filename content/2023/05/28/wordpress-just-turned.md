WordPress [just turned 20 years old](https://wordpress.org/news/2023/05/celebrating-20-years-of-wordpress/), which means I've been using it for different projects for a smidge under 20 years.

My memory is that I was about to use b2/cafelog for a project and someone told me to try this new fork, WordPress.

Cheers for making the web better, WordPress!
