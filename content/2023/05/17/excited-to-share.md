Excited to share another chapter of [the book](https://www.rebels.guide/so-youre-engaged/) today:

> I still distinctly remember the day after getting engaged and Brittâ€™s aunty called with thoughts on which horse-drawn carriage company we should use for our wedding. This was odd to me because in 2012 I had been creating weddings for over two years yet I had not even conceived of the idea that once I asked Britt to marry me that we would then proceed to a wedding.
