I'm passionate about making photos, but I have a sub-passion in recording good metadata around those photos as they enter my iCloud Photo Library so the photos become more useful as they age. Whether they are used in Photo Memories, like "Paris 2023" and "Early Mornings with Luna", or whether I want to search on the Photo's "Places" function to find that photo I made ten years ago, the metadata is important to me.

When I shoot on my iPhone, the metadata is collected (normally), and if I have remembered to force quit and re-open the Canon Camera Connect app that day, when I shoot on my Canon EOS R5 the metadata is recorded, but if I shoot on Britt's Fujifilm digital camera or my Leica film camera, no metadata is recorded by the camera.

In the [before time](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=The+Before+Time)s people used [notepads](https://fieldnotesbrand.com) with pens, which is a lovely prospect, but I have an iPhone in my pocket and a Watch on my wrist. So I made an Apple Shortcut that will record the metadata in time and in place for later use, either with an EXIF editor or my personal go-to app, [Metapho](https://apps.apple.com/app/id914457352) on the iPhone. (If you know of a Metapho competitor I'd be keen to hear it, I like Metapho but it feels forgotten by the developer and is sometimes buggy)

So these shortcuts will simply make a new Apple Note for the day if there isn't one already and record time and place, or if you use the second shortcut that dictates a note, also that text note.

I activate them either by tapping the home screen icon which is easy, or by asking Siri to "Record photography location".

Feel free to use, edit, mix, re-make, and share as you find useful and beneficial for the art of making photography.

Much gratitude to [Kyle Lines in the Automators Forum](https://talk.automators.fm/t/a-shortcut-to-record-photography-metadata-as-youre-shooting/15727) for helping me get the shortcuts over the line and useful for the greater population.
