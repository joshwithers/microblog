I stumbled across and subsequently visited an [NFT art gallery](https://nftfactoryparis.com) in Paris today whilst walking the streets with Luna and trying to escape the rain. The art curated inside was wild and beautiful, and a joy to take in, but I also had the opportunity to talk to the curator who shared openly about their business model and passion for showcasing, sharing, and encouraging art.

They typically curate the pieces showcased but they have open weeks where creators can buy a spot on the wall, and other weeks creators can rent the whole gallery.

I’m still trying to figure out how [my art](https://art.josh.withers.co) works and matters in the world - besides giving it away for free on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@joshwithers) and [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/@hellojoshwithers/) - but after visiting the gallery today I’m convinced that NFTs will have life and purpose long after the cryptobros move their hype engine somewhere else.

I even [picked up a piece](https://rainbow.me/0xC2F78D865FC4D179e74E61b92eA9233d5a61408d?family=indigo-x-evelyn-o&nft=0x40d69e63129c3524dc7e7abcbf401fc35668f998_3) that Luna loved.

It would be amazing to see my photos on a wall like that.
