Anthony shared this signed cover art in today's edition of [The Sizzle](https://thesizzle.com.au/) and very few images can conjure up so much nostalgia. I still remember visiting the shareware kiosk (computer in a box) at Video Ezy and downloading the shareware version of Doom onto two 3.5" floppy disks.
