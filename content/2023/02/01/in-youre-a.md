In [You're a Miracle (and a Pain in the Ass)](https://micro.blog/books/9781984823267) by Mike McHargue ðŸ“š:

> "You are a miracle because 86 billion neurons in your brain form into thousands of structures and networks, built from a map created over billions of years to understand the world you live in. But sometimes, you are a pain in your ass because all these networks are running a playbook thatâ€™s been around a lot longer than you have. The cells in your body have survived through the eons by eating every delicious calorie they come across, allowing fear to make them run, and using anger to make them fight for their lives."
