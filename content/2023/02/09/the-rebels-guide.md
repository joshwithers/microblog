Most people don’t know why they’re doing what they’re doing.

They imitate others, go with the flow, and follow paths without making their own.

They spend decades in pursuit of something that someone convinced them they should want, without realising that it won’t make them happy.

Don't be those people. Don't be those people in planning your wedding.

Reject the status quo. Reject the norm.

Embrace who you are. Embrace the idea that people like you two get married like 'this'! Embrace your weirdness, your uniqueness, the things that make the two of you a couple.

This is the way of the rebel.

This is the way you'll find in [The Rebel's Guide To Getting Married](https://rebels.guide).
