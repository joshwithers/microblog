I’ve just had my peak Mexican moment. I delivered a dad joke in Spanish and it was perfect.

I’m at our local sushi restaurant ordering takeaway dinner and whilst waiting at the bar they offer me a margarita, and you don’t say no to a margarita in Baja.

I finish it, and he gestured towards my empty glass to which I reply “esta roto” which means “it’s broken” whilst inspecting the bottom of my glass, implying that the drink must have fallen out of the bottom.

He laughs, I laugh, I’m now a Mexican dad and can never leave.
