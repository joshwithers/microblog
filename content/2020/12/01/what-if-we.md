Would the world be a better place if public comment functions were outlawed on the internet?

Imagine exactly the same internet, and social media, we know and love/hate today - the only difference being that you cannot comment on posts in a public manner.

You can still engage in private conversation with people, maybe even in groups up to 5 or 10. But above a certain number even group chats are banned.

The incentive is to split the broadcast of information, news, and opinion to either the masses, or micro-community.

Freedom of speech and freedom of broadcast is maintained, itâ€™s just the comments section that is doomed.

Thoughts? Feel free to privately contact me or your friends about it.
