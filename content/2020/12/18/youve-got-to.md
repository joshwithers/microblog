You’ve got to read this [LA Times report](https://www.latimes.com/projects/toxic-chemicals-planes-covid-19-travel-woes/) on how toxic jet engine fumes have been making their way into airplane’s air supplies FOR DECADES AND THE AVIATION INDUSTRY KNEW?! wtf.

> For decades, the airline industry and its regulators have known about these incidents — called fume events — and have maintained that they are rare and that the toxic chemical levels are too low to pose serious health risks.
