Collection of my favourite photos of 2020 // ðŸ–¼ All of Brighton // Well before @karenfrombrighton3186 did all of Brighton, back on the 5th day of March this year, I was in Melbourne making a photograph of all of Brighton Beach. Itâ€™s one of the framed prints Iâ€™ve made available in [my online store](https://ahoyjosh.com/collection)
