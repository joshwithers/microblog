Collection of my favourite photos of 2020 // ðŸ–¼ Burnt // Literally hours before rushing back to Queensland before the border closed, I made this photo from one of the regions affected by bushfires at the start of the year. Itâ€™s one of the framed prints Iâ€™ve made [available in my online store](https://ahoyjosh.com/collection)
