Search is broken.

When a local doctors surgery needs to run ads on its home page so Google is incentivised to rank that page higher - because Google makes money from displaying ads - then the whole thing is broken.

I understand the how and why of how and why were here. And the rankings on Google’s homepage are precious and meaningful to so many businesses, including mine, but what is the fix? It’s not like the Yellowpages were any better, if anything, the somewhat democratic algorithmic management of search rankings is better for the world.

But this is broken.

The only fix is possibly just walking down the street and asking for a appointment at reception.
