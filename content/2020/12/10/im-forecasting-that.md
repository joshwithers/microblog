I’m forecasting that within 12 months the remaining non-greys will be turned to the grey-side as we embark upon what will be our busiest and most taxing year ever. 2021 sees Britt and I with a newborn, a toddler, new 2021 weddings and elopements, and also most of 2020’s couples.

My friend Geoff at Motion Art Cinema said we should take before and after photos to see how 2021 ages us.

Bring it on 2021!
