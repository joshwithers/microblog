How to spot a good fish and chip shop.

1) it has the word ‘shack’ in its name
2) there are lobster pots hanging for styling
3) it’s near the ocean
4) it’s located at a wharf
5) Chico Rolls aren’t on the menu
6) there’s a grumpy fisherman on premises

Bonus points for the shack being a seafood type of shack, for example this one is called ‘The Lobster Shack’
