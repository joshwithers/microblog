A [story](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-31700049) about an Aussie athelete who posted himself in a crate from the UK to Australia, disappeared from Adelaide after he was charged with conspiracy to import cocaine, sentenced to death for drugs offences in Sri Lanka, but only spent five years in jail in Australia.
