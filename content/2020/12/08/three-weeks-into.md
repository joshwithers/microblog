Three weeks into taking a shot on Qoin, an Australian crypto currency launched by Batercard that you can actually use in retail and for services, and although I have not spent money yet, I’ve sold a few second hand things and from that injection of AUD I’m 12% up on Aussie dollar valuation over three weeks.

I wish I knew more about crypto currencies, but then whenever I look I feel like I know everything there is to know, so maybe it’s just all Wild West?
