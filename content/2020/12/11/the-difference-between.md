Call me biased, but I'm really proud of what Britt has created in [The Elopement Collective](https://elopementcollective.com). Not just because she's my wife or because I'm her celebrant for her elopements.

I'm proud of what she creates because it has heart, soul, and purpose. Tune in below for a hot take on elopements.

2020's really been the year for eloping, and I've watched on as everyone in the wedding industry has a go. It's been interesting seeing what people have made, and how couples have gotten married.

Here is the thing. An elopement is purely and only about two people getting married. It's not a small wedding, it's not a micro wedding, it's not a pop up wedding. Elopements aren't a photo shoot with a ceremony at the start, they aren't a styled shoot with some vows, they aren't about catering, styling, furniture, photos, film, florals, dresses, or venues. An elopement can have witnesses, but it's not about them, it's not about entertaining them, feeding them, occupying them, or hosting them.

An elopement is 100% and only about two people transitioning into marriage. If someone sees it, that's cream. If it happens somewhere lovey, that looks pretty, what a bonus. If we get a photo or two, and a film, we're in luck.

A wedding is about your guests, family and friends. An elopement is about the two of you.

I'll selfishly and proudly say that because The Elopement Collective was born out of a strong belief in the power of marriage and ceremony, we make the best elopements.

I'm proud of you Britt, you're my rockstar.
