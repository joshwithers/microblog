I've just watched an episode of The Wiggles where they're singing about, and boating in, The Big Red Boat. In this episode Anthony is assuming the position of captain, which is confusing, because for the first time in the entire show this is clearly a place where Captain Feathersword was the most qualified person for the job.

Why is Captain Feathersword landlocked even when The Wiggles go on the seven seas?

What's the real story with Captain Feathersword?
