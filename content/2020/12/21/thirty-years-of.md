Thirty years ago today the first website, recreated at [http://info.cern.ch](http://info.cern.ch), was born.

Thirty years earlier than that, the internet - the global system of interconnected computer networks - was conceived, but it wasn't until the hypertext markup languag, HTML, lead the way to a HTML viewer - a web browser - and the first website became viewable on the 20th of December 1990.

Almost a century earlier we started realising the power of machine as a computer, and thirty years after we started connecting them in a network, we gave birth to a method of publishing and sharing knowledge, stories, information, on "the web."

We've never been more connected, and more divided. Who knew that when we smelt so much of each other that it all wouldn't be like roses.
