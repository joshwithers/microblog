An aspect of Apple's strategy - marketing and business growth/sustainability - that is often forgotten when they launch products is this: filtering.

Not all of Apple's products are for everyone. They're for some people. If the [AirPods Max as a device, or at that price](https://www.apple.com/airpods-max/), offend you - you're being filtered out. Your response is the correct and desired response Apple wants you to have. If these were headphones for everyone they'd be $20 at a service station.

Honestly, it's a good reminder for anyone and everyone. You can't be the person, the service, the product for everyone. Even the world's most popular drink, or social network, or car, or phone, cannot reach the entire addresable market.

It's ok to be unpopular. In fact I would argue that being unpopular is the only way to happiness, financial sustainability, and the ability to sleep peacefully at night.

Popularity is eventually depressing, and mostly, a myth.
