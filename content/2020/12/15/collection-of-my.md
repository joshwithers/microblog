Collection of my favourite photos of 2020 // ðŸ–¼ Dunedin // The only international travel I made this year was to New Zealand. On a day off in between elopements Harley and I went to Dunedin and found this gem. [Itâ€™s one of the framed prints Iâ€™ve made available in my online store](https://ahoyjosh.com/collection)
