An interesting thought exercise is to imagine that something was being introduced fresh today, how would we approach it.

Much like how COVID-19 was introduced fresh just over a year ago, and we reacted as we did.

How would we react to cancer-causing cigarettes being introduced today? Or worse, road-accident causing cars, or violence and abuse causing alcohol?
