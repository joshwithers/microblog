The Age looks at the 2020 Melbourne lockdown with a modicum of hindsight.

> ‘‘No one had done lockdown before coronavirus. Maybe we wouldn’t have even thought of it had Wuhan not done it. There are still enormous gaps in the science – how much do you need to do, what is redundant and what really makes a difference? It is a very murky scientific area because most places, including us, threw everything at it at the same time.’’

[Prof. Sharon Lewis in The Age on the Melbourne lockdown](https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/how-we-beat-covid-part-one-the-way-in-20201210-p56mdr.html)
