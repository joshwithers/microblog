Politics, infrastructure, and the national broadband network, known as the National Broadband Network is an absolute joke.

> "The Minister for Communications, Urban Infrastructure, Cities and the Arts has made a formal declaration under section 48 of the National Broadband Network Companies Act 2011 that the National Broadband Network should be ‘treated as built and fully operational.’"

> "Under the Act the Minister must make such a declaration by 31 December 2020 – or formally extend the period within which such a declaration can be made."

So even though 35,000 properties aren't connected, thus the network is not 'built', we'll declare it built, otherwise that's a bit too much work.
