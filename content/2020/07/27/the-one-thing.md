The one thing I know for sure is also the one thing I am sure I am wrong about. Itâ€™s that I am the most important person in the world. That my experiences, thoughts, possessions, and relationships are the most important of them in existence. I have a lifetime of evidence proving it true, but I also know with great certainty that I am not the most important person on the planet, nor does the universe orbit around me.

If I am so sure that the one thing I know for certain, is incorrect, how can I ever be sure of anything ever again.
