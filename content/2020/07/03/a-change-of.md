Throughout this COVID time of life I didn't know where to go with my podcast, [The Rebels' Guide To Getting Married](https://therebels.guide).

Then I was listening to my friend's podcast, [Trevor Long's EFTM podcast](https://eftm.com), and he'd started taking calls helping people with tech support and tech buying decisions, and I realised that I used to do that for a living - take phone calls on the radio. So I've taken The Rebels' Guide to a talk radio kind of format. Think of it like talkback radio for weddings!

I'm a bit rusty on my radio skills, it's only been a decade, but here's my first episode back, I hope you love it :)
