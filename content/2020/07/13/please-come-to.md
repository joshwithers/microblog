Based on the laughs I’m getting from our toddler as she watches my rehearsals I’m betting that my move into stand up comedy is going to be a raging success, so I’m proud to announce my first touring comedy show.

Come and watch a 38 year old man put a dummy in his mouth, even though he isn’t a baby; watch as this father pretends to take your food if you won’t eat it; be amazed as a Gold Coast marriage celebrant dances with you in front of a mirror.

Tickets are $30.
