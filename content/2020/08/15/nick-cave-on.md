Nick Cave [on Cancel Culture, and mercy](https://www.theredhandfiles.com/what-is-mercy-for-you/).

>”Mercy is a value that should be at the heart of any functioning and tolerant society. Mercy ultimately acknowledges that we are all imperfect and in doing so allows us the oxygen to breathe — to feel protected within a society, through our mutual fallibility. Without mercy a society loses its soul, and devours itself."
