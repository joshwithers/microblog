I thought I'd take the time to tell you an old story from the first time I ever thought about a wedding, it was actually 25 years ago this month.

So on this one faithful August night in 1995, I was about to propose to my girlfriend when my roommate Joseph barged onto the verandah out of nowhere, tripped and fell over, breaking a glass outdoor table with his face.

Totally ruined the mood.

Now, I didn't know Joseph that well, I can't even remember where he was from, but I'm sure you could imagine I put my plans on hold to help get him to the hospital.

Joseph had gotten big glass shard in his eye leaving him completely blind in that eye. He was walking around with one of those cotton pads on his eye for a couple of months. Then suddenly, he disappeared, along with my girlfriend!

Apparently they'd bonded during the time after his injuries, and they eloped together, leaving me behind without as much as a note. I tried to track them down, but never could. 

As happy as I am today, if it hadn't been for cotton eye Joe, I'd have been married a long time ago.

Where did you come from, where did you go? Where did you come from, cotton eye Joe?
