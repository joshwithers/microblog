Anyone else have an issue with the idea that we as a people struggle to do the right thing in a pandemic unless our civil liberties are severely restricted by legislators?

The idea that collectively we struggle to make good decisions for the community we live in without a bunch of rules written down on stone tablets, is getting a bit old.

But maybe thatâ€™s the only way we can succeed?
