We live in the age of general. Where the average is enough.

Where we make great arguments over Brand A versus Brand B, dismissing the million shades of gray between them.

Where we call people and politicians left and right, like there really are only two types of people.

Where conversation about nuanced ideas, be it faith, politics, authors, ideas, medicine, or family, are dismissed if they arenâ€™t your own beliefs.

I long for the age of nuance.

For a time where we could just chat.
