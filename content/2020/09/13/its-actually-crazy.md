It’s actually crazy that public policy for resuming work and life in Australia is hinging on an unknown, possibly non-existent, possibly not effective, not tested, Covid vaccine.

It’s like me saying I’ll stop punching you once an alien spaceship arrives.

You’re going to have some bruises and you’ll probably never see an alien.
