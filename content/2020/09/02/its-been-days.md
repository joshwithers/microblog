It’s been 183 days since the first postponement email. The longest 183 days of my life.
154 displaced weddings and elopements.
Some couples are onto their third, fourth, and fifth wedding or elopement date or location.
46 cancelled flights to 15 different countries.
$67,200 in cancelled invoices for future elopements or weddings.
Thousands more lost to non-refundable accomodation, ferries, etc and about $20,000 tied up in travel vouchers. If anyone wants to fly Brussels Airlines before December 31 I’ve got some vouchers.
Who knows the actual real cost to our business (me + The Elopement Collective).
3 court appearances coming up because we couldn’t refund and the couple didn’t want to reschedule.

1 virus.

I’m ready for all of this to be over now.
How has Covid-19 affected you?
