The reason I'll stay a wedding celebrant as long as they'll have me, despite pandemics and BS, is because of the bizarre and beautiful relationship I have with our couples.

Emailing with a couple at the moment and they're literally looking into ways to get an exemption for me to be with them at their wedding in California.

Despite 2020, the wedding industry is still the best place to be employed.

Except for working at KFC of course. The easy and direct access to fried chicken is obviously really cool.
