I'm a guest on [George Dimarelos's podcast, Book(ish)](https://overcast.fm/+Y6Epjcm8s) talking about [Malcolm Gladwell's latest book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43848929-talking-to-strangers), Talking To Strangers. So it's not just about the book, it's about my life's experiences that basically leave me an anxious wreck thinking that no-one understands me. [It's pretty much a therapy session recorded for your entertainment.](https://overcast.fm/+Y6Epjcm8s/)
