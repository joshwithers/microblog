Look, I'm not going to tell you who to vote for, but I'll happily tell you that dinosaur owner and political party creator, Clive Palmer, is spending a lot of money spreading lies about a death tax that doesn't exist.

Luckily/sadly their website can't handle the traffic ...

How can lies like this be spread so easily without reprucussions?

[Here's a news piece about the death tax lie](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/28/clive-palmers-death-tax-scare-campaign-isnt-new-but-its-still-outrageous).

>In their most outrageous form, the ads feature Palmer’s United Australia party candidates (such as his wife) urging electors to “Stop Labor’s 20% Death Tax”. Labor has no policy to reintroduce a tax on bequests, however large the inheritance, anywhere in Australia. The framing, the rising inflection in the speaker’s voice and the faux specificity of the claim are all designed to arouse emotion and credulity, by diverting attention from its factual baselessness.
