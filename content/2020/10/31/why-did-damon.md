Sharing because I feel like I'm not the only person wondering where Damon Wayons Jr went after the pilot episode of New Girl.

>the reason behind this change was that Wayans was also part of the cast of Happy Endings, and as he was expecting it to be canceled, he joined New Girl. However, Happy Endings was renewed for a second season, and he had to leave New Girl.
