Anyone else struggling getting their head in a good and peaceful place at the moment?

[Luke Fletcher](https://www.lukefletcherphoto.com) just sent me this pic of Luna from this time last year when we were in New York together for [an elopement with The Elopement Collective](https://elopementcollective.com).

My brain is in a constant state of change, one minute thinking about how nice it is to be at home and to pick Luna up from kindy, next minute I’m thinking about the 44 of our couples who have booked us but don’t have a new date yet and the 180 movements our couples have made to their wedding and elopement plans around the globe, then my mind wanders to the administrative nightmare that is my computer and my inbox and how I should probably accidentally drop the MacBook into a pond to save me cleaning up the files on the desktop, and before long my mind wanders to the reality of our 2020 and where we were supposed to be have been right now, and how a little virus has changed all that. From there it’s not long before I start thinking about the government policies around it all, and what that means for the state of our society and how our futures will all be dramatically different.

I feel such an emotional burden for our couples, for the people contacting me about new wedding plans, and so many of my friends that are battling the same burdens.

Like my own personal antenna in my mind is tuning into everything going on everywhere, so much noise, chaos, and pure humanity. It’s beautiful, and strange, and chaotic, and weird.

It’s a weird 2020, and I feel like it’s going to be a weird 2021, I’m not sure my head will ever be in a peaceful place again.

Shout out to [Rob Bell for his podcast about our antennas](https://robbell.podbean.com/e/you-and-your-antenna/). It was a weird embrace to acknowledge where my head is at today.

It’s a strange time to be a [guy who stands in the middle of your marriage ceremony](https://joshwithers.com.au) and breathes your marriage to life.
