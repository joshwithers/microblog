The iPhone 12 Pro in-hand feel is remarkably different to the past six generations of iPhone with the rounded edges. The 90 degree edge of the iPhone 12 makes it feel better in-hand and I could imagine using it case-less.

12 Pro camera quality increase is so noticeable from an iPhone XS, the HDR is borderline "too much‚Äù as far as regular photos go, but it's also representative of what we actually see with our eyes.

MagSafe is but another entry to the lineup of Apple things that "just works" and you'd hope it would.

MagSafe cases and accessories are in low supply this early, but I'm excited to see how vendors innovate, like [Peak Design is on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/peak-design/mobile-by-peak-design-phone-cases-mounts-chargers-magsafe).

Considering the rounded bump is no longer pushing out the width, the screen feels more edge to edge, the entire phone just looks beautiful. I'm rocking the new deep blue colour.

Moving from an iPhone XS, the only thing I'm mourning is 3D Touch/Force Touch. I apparently used it a lot more than I could remember. Long touch isn't quite the same.

If you're on an iPhone 11, the 12 is a splurge. If you're moving from an iPhone XS/XR, it's real nice. From a X or 8, or earlier, you'll be grateful for the numerous improvements. If you're on Android, congrats on reading so far into the review!
