Science ... the [microcovid.org](https://www.microcovid.org/) website calculates the risk of you contracting COVID-19.

This is my risk profile for "going to bars regularly" in Queensland, talking to random people for 20 minutes at a time if we're all not wearing masks and at normal standing distances (3ft).

0.7-in-a-million.
