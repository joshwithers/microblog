“Discovering things is clumsy and sporadic, and the results don't at first compare well with the glossy and lauded works of the past. You have to keep reminding yourself that they went through that as well, otherwise they become frighteningly accomplished.” - [Brian Eno](http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/brian_eno/email.html)
