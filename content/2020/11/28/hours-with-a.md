This is a black magic machine that is fast and beautiful and literally what I want in a computer.

The [reviews are all true and accurate](https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/11/m1-macs-review/). Even for the bottom tier of Apple's computer lineup, this is the speediest, most responsive Mac I've ever owned or used. Early in the year I moved to a Macbook Pro 16" to get the speed and responsiveness I'm getting from this MacBook Air, and the 16" feels like a dinosaur.

It's whimiscal to be running iOS/iPadOS apps right on my Mac. It makes me wonder why it's such a terrible user experience for iPadOS to run iPhone apps when it's downright lovely on a MacBook Air.

The slow onward progression of security makes my [audio apps by Rogue Amoeba](https://weblog.rogueamoeba.com/2020/11/24/public-betas-available-for-the-new-m1-chip-based-macs/) feel like I'm hacking a mainframe, but we got there in the end.

The only thing to wait for now is for developers to move their apps from Intel to Universal architetures so they run even faster, and to see what on earth more professional, progressive, and well cooled Apple computers can look like.

I've gone from the highest spec'd portable Apple portable computer running an Intel processor, to what will undoubtedly become the slowest Apple Silicon Mac ever released, and it's like I've gone from crawling to walking.

The future is bright for Apple computers.
