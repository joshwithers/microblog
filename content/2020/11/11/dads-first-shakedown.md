I asked my friend James Day to photograph Luna and I shaking down Jake because he owes me money*. I shook him up and down hoping coins would fall out but his mum said he only uses Apple Pay now so there were no coins.

As far as shakedowns go, I’m proud of Luna and I, we brought a pretty strong game for our first one. James also made lovely photos. 5 out of 5 shakedown.

*by money I mean a cookie.
