It's that time of year agin for me to be that wet paper bag of a man I am and say that Melbourne Cup, horse racing, gambling, and the entire culture in Australia that supports and celebrates the three is embarrassing and sad.

Please continue eating your roast chicken and drinking your wine knowing that I like wine and chicken, but don't like what gambling or horse racing does.
