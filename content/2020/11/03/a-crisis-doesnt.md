>”A crisis doesn’t have to be a negative event. A wedding is a crisis–one ceremony, one day, over and done. All eyes, all attention, all on this moment. That’s why we do it–even though the chronic condition of the marriage itself is always more important.”

– [Seth Godin, on a useful crisis](https://seths.blog/2020/11/the-useful-crisis/)
