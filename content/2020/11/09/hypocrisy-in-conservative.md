Only a few moons ago here in Australia the conservative and rather religious politicans embodied by the oddly named 'Liberal Party of Australia' fought tooth and nail against marriage equality. A former leader of that party, who also once identified as the Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Turnbull, said on Four Corners:

> “There is no question that some of the most trenchant opponents of same sex marriage - all in the name of traditional marriage - were at the same time enthusiast practitioners of traditional adultery. The controversy over same sex marriage was dripping with hypocrisy and the pools were deepest at the feet of the sanctimonious.”

Before this marriage equality debacle, a rabbi who has never made any comments on marriage equality, despite his heavy teachings on so many other topics, commented on these politicans. Originally hailing from Nazareth, Jesus [said](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2023&version=NIV):

> “Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when you have succeeded, you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are."
