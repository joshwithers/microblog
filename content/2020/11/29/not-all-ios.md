Much has been written and podcasted about how terrible the iOS apps running on Apple Silicon situation has been a pretty poor show. But my experience has been above average.

I thought I'd showcase the apps I'd installed and used that were pretty good considering they weren't developed for use with a keyboard and mouse/touchpad.

## Instagram
Despite being disallowed by the developers, a little .ipa workaround saw Instagram's iOS app easily install on the Mac. The app is flawless from my using, scrolling, posting, and clicking around. The two glaring issues with this experience are that iPadOS's dealing with iPhone-only apps is dismal, and that Instagram's developers have a deep need to keep Insta off the desktop and tablet.

## LumaFusion
The iPad's and iPhone's best linear video editor just works simply and beautifully on the Mac now.

## Air Hockey (the OG)
When the App Store launched on the iPhone there was an intial blood rush of apps that took advantage of being able to develop applications on a colourful mutlitouch pocket computer. Air Hockey was one of the early releases and I remember showing it to a mesmerised friend. It plays beautifully!

## DJI Go 4
I haven't flown with it yet, but I'm excited by the idea of using my MacBook as a monitor for the DJI Mavic 2 Pro remote.

## Qantas
My airline of choice has so far allowed it's booking and account management app, and it's inflight entertainment app to be installed on Mac and it's mostly fine.

## Overcast
The iOS apps that will shine on Apple Silicon Macs are the ones developed to the very spec of Apple's Huamn Interface Guidelines and everything else ever preached at a WWDC session. So of course Marco Arment's Overcast app works flawlessly, with a resizeable window, and it's just a joy to use.

## AirBnb
I don't know if an app will be better than a website, but hey, AirBnb works.

## Skip
My local coffee shop's coffee ordering and line skipping platform of choice, Skip, works a beaut.

## Cowbell
Sometimes you just need to be able to announce to people in the same room as you that more cowbell is required.

On top of this list I'll add Good Sodoku, my little girl's kindy social network - Storypark - and Lumy.
