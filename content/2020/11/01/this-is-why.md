> “The human condition is designed for travel. Our brains evolved to geotag memories, initially to find or avoid predators, food and mates. When we recall memories of people, songs, dates or events, they are returned with their associated locations. While we normalise our oft-visited locations, it's the novel locations that remain highlighted along with the travel experiences we had there which re-invigorate our interest in business and recreational travel. This is why we will never want to stop travelling.”

— Captain Richard Champion de Crespigny, aka the Qantas A380 pilot from that Singapore incident, in [Traveller](https://www.traveller.com.au/qf32-qantas-a380-engine-explosion-captain-richard-champion-de-crespigny-grounded-by-covid19-h1rswc)
