In the first year of going full time with the business of being a celebrant each time someone booked me I'd elatedly call Britt with this overwhleming feeling of joy and emotion that someone would choose me, plus I'd be secretly crying.

After a few years it becomes a little bit normal, still special, but I generally didn't cry when people booked me.

Just got a booking. Got emotional, told Britt, cried a wee bit. Feels good.

See you in December, Adelaide!
