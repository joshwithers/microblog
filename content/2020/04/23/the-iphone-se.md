The range of hardware seemingly now known as iPhone SE is in some ways the last hurrah for a generation of iPhone.

The iPhone SE 2016 was the ultimate of the iPhone 4/5/5S line, and the iPhone SE 2020 is the ultimate 6/6S/7/8.

John Gruber [says it well](https://daringfireball.net/2020/04/the_2020_iphone_se) in his 2020 model review, "Like the iPhone 5-style 2016 iPhone SE before it, the new iPhone 6-style iPhone SE feels like the canonical ideal of the form factor it embodies."

The iPhone SE of 2023 or 2024 will no doubt be the ultimate, best-of, version of the iPhone X/XS/11 range.
