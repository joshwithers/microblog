The ABC (Australia’s for my international friends) has done an outstanding job of documenting the Australian bushfires in [this single article](https://apple.news/AjPHVbsNtRtqXsg9JFggWEw). I haven’t seen reporting like this from anyone.

The first bushfire mentioned is 30km/18 miles inland from our home, but we were fine.
