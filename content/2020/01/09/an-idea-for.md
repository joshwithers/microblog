Here's a (hopefully) possible and good idea for Apple and the FBI.
Instead of Apple building unhealthy encryption-breaking backdoors and the FBI [generally complaining about iPhone security](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/01/08/fbi-apple-pensacola-shooter), what if iOS often looked for a wifi network that it could always backup to.

Maybe it's called "Apple Backup" and if a phone has power and it sees that network, it knows the password because Apple has decided the password is something like P@ssw0rd, and when all those stars align the phone backs up to iCloud. Law enforcement agencies can then take the opportunity to take the regular route of making a request through a court to Apple for that data in iCloud.
