An easy call to action would be to tell everyone to download the What3Words app, but ultimately, Iâ€™d like to see Apple, Microsoft, Google, and other mapping services integrate the service natively. [This Tasmanian rescue story](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-05-13/what3words-used-to-locate-missing-walkers-on-flinders-island/12241352) is a great example of its power.
