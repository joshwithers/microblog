It’s a popular theory that Facebook/Google/Apple is listening to our conversations. They’re not, they don’t need to. The data we share everywhere else, [like on Untappd](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2020/05/18/military-and-intelligence-personnel-can-be-tracked-with-the-untappd-beer-app/), tells a bigger story. Like where an Air Force drone pilot is working.
