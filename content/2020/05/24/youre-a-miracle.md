You’re A Miracle (And A Pain In The Ass) by Mike McHargue is an important book for the humans of Planet Earth.

It’s not important for the ground breaking research or scientific findings it contains, they’re accurately credited to the many smart people that found them in years past.

This book is important because of the important narrative that Mike weaves through the understanding that we humans are beautifully fantastic miracles, yet in so many countless ways thanks to our brains, childhood trauma, and the hyper connected world we live in today, we are massive pains in the asses.

Reading this book has given me so much insight into my own behaviours and just plain old stupid stuff I do everyday.

Thank you for writing this book, Mike 🙏🏻
