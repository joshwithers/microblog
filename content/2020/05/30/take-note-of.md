Take note of the businesses that get through COVID-19 alive. In the years prior, they saved their money, they played the long game, minimised debt, employed assets and fired those that did not bring value. The businesses still alive and kicking in 2021 were charging what they were worth, and then some, in 2019. They know how to run a sustainable business, and theyâ€™re worthy of your trade.
