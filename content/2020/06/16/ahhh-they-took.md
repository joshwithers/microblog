The non-believer continues to be shunned. Fifteen years ago [Charlie the Unicorn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZu3P0OsQPk) went to Candy Mountain, and now the Grand Finale is rolling out in parts, [part one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HvyUSZcDk4) was released last year, [part two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nXM1R0PlTo) just dropped, and part 3 is "coming soon". What a time to be alive.
