If you have ever wondered what the day's most awkward phone call would sound like, imagine that you're a wedding celebrant calling a wedding venue co-ordinator to thank them for referring couples to you recently because you've had two bookings there this in the last few days.
And the wedding co-ordinator not only doesn't recommend you, but doesn't know who you are.
I am the one who knocks ... awkwardly.
