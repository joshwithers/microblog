Lots of talk about censorship from this week from people who must think that its ok for me to come to their house, write hateful and/or untrue things on their wall, and because of free speech they have to leave it there when I leave.

Freedom of speech doesn't mean freedom of distribution.

Particularly when the speech is a lie or hate.
