So look, I don't want to be 'that guy', but two of the higher profile cases of COVID-19 test in Australia - the bloke in Blackwater, and the Black Lives Matter protestor - are people who's initial tests were positive, then secondary tests came back negative.
Is there at all the slightest chance that this whole COVID thing needs a bit of critical analysis done on it?
Slightest possibility that we, as a people, could apply critical thinking and maybe pull back on the fear and the craziness?
Reckon we could open some borders, and get some businesses back to work?
I'll be over here in the ranty corner, have a great day.
