A few years ago I had that blog and podcast called Unpopular, and what [@cabel](https://micro.blog/cabel) is talking about is what I was trying to explore.

For context, this tweet is about @1Password taking on $200M investment for growth.

I think about this “often unexplored middle ground” daily.
