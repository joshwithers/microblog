In [May 2018](https://joshwithers.blog/2018/05/17/an-apple-camera.html) I theorised that Apple’s ultra personal computing platform would diverge into a Wrist-first CPU and an Apple Camera. As I read [@gruber](https://micro.blog/gruber)’s [iCamera piece](https://daringfireball.net/2019/09/the_iphone_11_and_iphones_11_pro) I wondered whether my theory might not be far off.
