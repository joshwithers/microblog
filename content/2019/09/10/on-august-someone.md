‪On August 10 someone in Brazil made a $1.62 AUD payment through my manual payment page on my website. It allows people to pay their invoices in ful or part by entering their details and how much they want to pay, and Stripe processes the payment.‬<br /><br />‪It seemed weird at the time.‬<br /><br />This week the assumed scammer has disputed the transaction.<br /><br />At the time of the transaction I notified Stripe that I believed it was a scam of some sort, and now that they want to charge me a $25 dispute fee I’m reminding them of that conversation, but ...<br /><br />What do you think the scam is? I’m always fascinated by internet scams and how they actually make money. How is paying me $1.62 then disputing it actually making the scammer money?
