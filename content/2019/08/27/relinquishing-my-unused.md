I saw recently that Ricky Gervais recently let go of the band names he’d been holding on to and I felt inspired to do the same.

Here’s my wedding business names I’ve realised I’ll never start. Feel free to use them.

Isle Marry You – for celebrants who do weddings on islands.

Aeiou – a stock standard vow service.

I Donut – a rebrand for the celebrant trying work less so they can spend more time with their family and donuts.

I Due – a celebrant who specialises in weddings for pregnant women.

Something Burrowed – for the Cooper Pedy celebrant.

Canaloupe – a celebrant who can offer elopements and also likes fruit puns.

Meowied By Name – if you're a cat lady and a celebrant.

Maui'd By Name - for celebrants on the island of Maui.

In Tents Ceremonies – a celebrant service that offers really intense ceremonies but is packaged with a tipi.

For Butter Or Worse – for a celebrant who is out of the ordindairy.

Pitcher Perfect Weddings – one if you're a wedding photographer who also brews beer and serves it in your photo shoot.
