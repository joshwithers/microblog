I started thinking about Britt and my wedding, seven years ago next month, and what we would have done differently. It’s something I’m asked by most couples.<br /><br />Honestly I’m picking at straws to think of things I would change. We had a ball!<br /><br />I often tell people that if I could go back I’d probably change our decision to have a bridal party. Ours was full of fine people, but it’s probably the only slack I’d cut off. We’d still get ready together with the same people, and I’d still get Scotty to pray for us and Ash to make a speech, but I just wouldn’t force them to stand up with us in matching clothes.<br /><br />Oh, I would also get Michael Eotvos to come and play live music through the ceremony instead of getting our mate Andy to DJ the ceremony.<br /><br />What would you change about your wedding?
