[On dying](https://geordieguy.au/logging-off.html), from [@Geordie@aus.social](https://micro.blog/Geordie@aus.social) who recently died:

> It’s because we don’t die online properly.

> We need a way to die online. If my time comes tomorrow, I want the offline funeral to serve as a way — as best as funerals can — of drawing a line under my life and letting the grieving process begin.
