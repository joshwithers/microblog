The CEO of the biggest supermarket chain in Australia is stepping down because no other news media dared question an advertiser.

This is the strength and power of listener/reader supported media, and the strength of publicly funded media.

You can't lose an advertiser because you asked good questions, because you aren't reliant on, or don't have, advertisers.

Our reluctance to individually fund good journalism are part of the reason our groceries are so expensive, that and because we're too lazy to shop around, or better, buy local food from local producers.
