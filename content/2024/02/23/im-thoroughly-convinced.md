I'm thoroughly convinced that email can be a meaningful method of communication, relationship, community, and entertainment in the future. I've always been proud of what my friend [@james@bne.social](https://micro.blog/james@bne.social) is making at [@podnews.net](http://podnews.net) so reading [this article](https://www.editorandpublisher.com/stories/newsletter-20-the-emergence-of-single-page-media,248246) by Guy Tasaka encourages me in my little prophetic thought.

> I have a deep appreciation for newsletters. They say everything old is new again. Today, with an almost overwhelming amount of information we must sift through on news sites, social media and third-party aggregation sites, like Apple and Google News, itâ€™s nice to have information curated and summarized for me and delivered to my inbox. That kind of sounds like a newspaper.
