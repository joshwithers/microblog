If you talk to anyone in the destination wedding industry they have their bucket list of places they want to work. Mine is remarkably weirder than most.

I've been lucky enough to create marriage ceremonies all around the world in places like Iceland and Italy, New York and New Zealand, Croatia to Canberra, Fiji to Vancouver.

But my favourite places to travel are the weird places, more likely to be featured on Atlas Obscurer than Lonely Planet.

My destination wedding and elopement bucket list:

1. North Korea because I want to fly Air Koryo and live to tell the story.
2. Saudia Arabia and Qatar because a Middle East desert elopement would be wild! Plus I'd love to be the guy that delivers personalised and fun wedding ceremonies in the Middle East.
3. Tuvalu, Bora Bora, Tonga, Samoa, and The Cook Islands because I've got big Pacific Island energy.
4. Bhutan where Gross National Happiness is a real thing they measure.
5. Kazakhstan because of Borat.

I think it would also be cool to do a wedding in Llanfair­pwllgwyngyll­gogery­chwyrn­drobwll­llan­tysilio­gogo­goch in Wales because writing that name on a marriage certificate would be fun.
