Julian Assange and the criminalisation of journalism: A story of moral injury and moral courage [in New Matilda today](https://newmatilda.com/2024/07/08/julian-assange-and-the-criminalization-of-journalism-a-story-of-moral-injury-and-moral-courage/?utm_source=mailpoet&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=julian-assange-and-the-criminalization-of-journalism-43):

> 12th July 2007: Two US Apache helicopters unleash 30mm cannon fire on a group of Iraqi civilians. Two of them are Reuters journalists – Namir Noor-Eldeen and Saeed Chmagh.

> Twelve are killed, including both journalists and a passing van driver who stops to help the wounded. The van driver’s two young children, passengers at the time, are severely wounded.

> The journalists’ cameras were later retrieved from the soldiers who had seized them. They indicated no evidence of the firefight the US military claimed had prompted the strike.

> 5th April 2010: WikiLeaks releases a video titled Collateral Murder, confirmed as authentic by the US military. The grainy footage taken from one of the Apaches documents the casual slaughter of noncombatants. You can hear the crew laughing at some of the casualties.
