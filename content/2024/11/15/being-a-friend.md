John Gruber [tells the story](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/13/atkinson-prayers) of Bill Atkinson’s battle (that has not finished yet) with cancer:

> “In addition to being a genius programmer, he’s by all accounts a kind and generous person. Everyone was (and remains to this day) in awe of his skills, but they remember him best for being a friend.”

As a human, a man, a husband, and a father, I often (let’s be honest, almost always) get tied up with the worry and fear about work and business, earning money, and making good financial decisions.

Keeping a good professional reputation in the desperate hope and prayer that another couple would find me and book me for their wedding.

Staying in the good graces of wedding venues, wedding planners, the different algorithms and industry blogs and publications.

But I swear if I get to the end of my days and you, Britt, and my children can't remember me best for being a friend then it was all for nought.

I'm sorry if I've missed the mark on our friendship, it's honestly all I really want from these few fragile moments we have together on this pale blue dot in the universe.
