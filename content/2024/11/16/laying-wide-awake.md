Laying wide awake, trying to sleep in a Perth hotel, so I thought crunching some annual stats might help me sleep.

2024 has been a wild year of travel. Here’s my 2024 travel stats as of when I get home on December 2:

For 53% of 2024 I have slept in a bed I do not call home. 172 nights away from home, 94 flights, 85 marriage ceremonies, 275 hours in the air, 47 visits to Hobart Airport, 37 rental cars, 27 hours lost to flight delays, 15 airports, seven countries, six airlines, six Australian states, three trains, two boats, one moped.

Qantas Platinum, Virgin Gold, Hotels.com Gold, and Accor Gold, Mitre 10 Silver. No I’m not joking about Mitre 10.

Ask me anything except about the moped.
