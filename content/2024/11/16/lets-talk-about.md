Let's talk about the disconnect between mainstream media, social media chatter, and reality in Perth's coffee scene.

When Starbucks opened their first WA store recently, both mainstream and social media were full of people insisting Perth would reject it in favour of local cafes.

Well, I just visited this morning... The reality? Over 100 people inside and a 40+ car drive-through queue. Before 9am on a Saturday.

Just a reminder that media opinions and online discussions don't always reflect what's actually happening on the ground. That Starbucks is absolutely thriving.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
