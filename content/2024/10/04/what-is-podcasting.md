Dave Winer's [2004 definition of podcasting](http://secrets.scripting.com/whatIsPodcasting) is what I think podcasting is:

>Think how a desktop aggregator works. You subscribe to a set of feeds, and then can easily view the new stuff from all of the feeds together, or each feed separately.
> Podcasting works the same way, with one exception. Instead of reading the new content on a computer screen, you listen to the new content on an iPod or iPod-like device.
> Think of your iPod as having a set of subscriptions that are checked regularly for updates. Today there are a limited number of programs available this way. The format used is RSS 2.0 with enclosures.
> In the future, radio shows like All Things Considered and Rush Limbaugh will be available in this manner, and perhaps other syndication formats will support enclosures.

But I feel like mainstream culture imagines a podcast is a group of people sitting in a room with headphones on and it's watched via TikTok or Reels.

Which, I'm not going to lie, is quite confronting for a nerd like me who really enjoys his traditional podcasting.
