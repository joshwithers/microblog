I made the 4am alarm to catch the 2024 Swell Sculpture Festival before sunrise this morning and as always it was a treat.
Something that stood out to me, and I don't know if it was new this year, but much of the art was priced. Some of the sculptures were on the way to $100,000!
If you can create art and put a price on it, and earn that price, then you're doing a thousand times better than I who simply places his art on Unsplash and Pexels in lieu of doing the hard work of making art that people want, putting a price on it that represents value and effort, and putting it to market.
More power to the artists who can exchange their art for good money, society will be better off for it.
These are the pieces that captured me, one in particular was interesting, the "Personal Space Elevator".
