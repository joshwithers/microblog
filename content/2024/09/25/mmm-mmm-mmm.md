The story-song by the Crash Test Dummies, 'Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm', played this morning and I decided to - for the first time in my life - examine the song's lyrics.

It's essentially the story of three children in not-ideal situations, but not neccesarily bad or negative situations. Not underwhelming or overwhelming. Just three kids in whelming situations.

The first is the story of a boy whose hair is bleached as a result of a car accident. The second a girl with birthmarks on her body. The song then turns on a bridge when it's revealed that their stories aren't as bad as the third who has simply "always just gone" to a pentecostal church.

In response Canadian singer Brad Roberts - with that iconic bass-baritone voice - sings 'Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.'

Which I guess is his way of saying, "cool story bro."

So now, from this day forward I intend to reply to all cool stories with an mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, and if anyone questions my reply I'll not acknowledge them with anything but an mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm if it feels appropriate.

I'm just being my best reply guy self.
