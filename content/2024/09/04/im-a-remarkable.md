I'm a Remarkable tablet user and was excited to see what they launched today but I'm out of the live stream already. Colour e-ink and a bigger screen aren't on my list of desired changes.

Better, much better, Remarkably better, software is needed.

Anyway, how cute is it watching every tech founder today wanna be Steve Jobs.
