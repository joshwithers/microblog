I’ve got a genuine interest inst in the new Pixel phones. Genuinely curiosity if they’d feel nice in hand, how the UI feels, how it works. Maybe they’re a real competitor to the iPhone.

But sampling the product is nigh impossible. They’re on display in shops but covered in security accessories that stop you from folding the folding phone or holding it in hand, plus this one in particular set the alarm off if it was picked up.

I wonder what the cost of loss of sales is compared to stock loss due to theft? Also, it sucks that we live in a world now where theft is so common.
