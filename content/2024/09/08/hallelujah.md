[Hallelujah, Leonard Cohen, and a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer's suicide, by Yashvardhan Jain](https://subtledigressions.substack.com/p/hallelujah-leonard-cohen-and-a-pulitzer):

> It took Cohen over four years to write Hallelujah. It was a process filled with agony, writing over eighty verses, stuck in a cycle of writing and discarding. In one of the interviews Cohen gave later in his life, he talks about this torment.

And this which always encourages me in creating my own art:

> And Hallelujah, the first song on the LP’s second side, went unnoticed. Nobody cared. It seemed Hallelujah was fated for a quick extinction and would disappear into the void like most music, like a ‘broken Hallelujah’.
