[This reporting on the mysterious 777 Partners and it's Australian investment in airline, Bonza](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-04/777-partners-the-private-equity-firm-behind-bonza/103802624) is a good read and good reporting by Ian Verrender and the ABC.

> Virgin Blue executive Tim Jordan, claimed from the outset that he needed 10 aircraft to make the new operation viable. When he called in administrators this week, he had just four.

> The large Boeing 737s are arguably the wrong fit for Bonza, flying second and third-tier routes, and appear to have been used as a means to soak up the US backer's fleet and provide it with income.
