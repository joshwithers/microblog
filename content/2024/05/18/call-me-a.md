Call me a conspiracy theorist, call me crazy, or call me stupid, but I get a feeling that TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, Threads, Twitter, LinkedIn and honestly any algorithm-driven social network isn't the place for deeper thinking, intellect, and non-viral-bs-business ideas. So I'm investing what little business-intelligence capital into my own blog and email. It's called Aisle Authority, I write it every day, and it looks like this. Read it and even subscribe like a madman at [aisleauthority.email](https://aisleauthority.email).
