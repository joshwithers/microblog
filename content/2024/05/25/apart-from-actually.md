Apart from actually doing the work couples pay me to do, like making their weddings and elopements, some of the proudest professional work I'm doing these days is in [Aisle Authority](https://www.aisleauthority.email), my daily letter to the world's best wedding creators.
If you create weddings for a living like I do, it's the kind of daily business encouragement I wanted to receive but no-one was making, so I wrote one.
