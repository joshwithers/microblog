You know what sucks about using the internet today - whether it's Facebook or Instagram or Threads - is that they're all geared towards virality, these big pieces of content that goes so far.

There's not really any room for me just to bitch and moan about being stranded at Melbourne Airport for five hours this morning when I want to be home.

I guess that's for the better. Who wants to hear about me being stranded to Melbourne Airport?

The thing I miss though is that sharing our mundane life was a fundamental part of the social web 15 years ago and I miss your food photos and flights delay posts.
