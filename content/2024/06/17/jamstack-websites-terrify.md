Jamstack websites terrify me.

I feel technology often takes a backward step as it advances.

I used to make the most powerful small business, single use case, applications in Microsoft Access for businesses. To do the same today is so much harder. It's the same with websites. Jamstack is exponentially more complex than Wordpress and its PHP brethren.
