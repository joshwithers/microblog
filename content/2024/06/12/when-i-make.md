When I make photos I like I share them, and because of the way the world is today (i.e everyone has a camera, algorithms rule the world, photos don't get as much airtime as videos, plus no-one knows who I am) most people never see my photos, so I upload them to [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@joshwithers) and [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/@hellojoshwithers/).

Something I find super interesting is how even on those two sites the per-photo statistics vary so wildly.
