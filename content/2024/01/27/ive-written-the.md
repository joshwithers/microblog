I've written the first seven issues of my new daily email letter for wedding celebrants: Aisle Authority.

I'm writing for the North American wedding officiants and celebrants that contact me every day, but Aussies and well honestly anyone, is welcome to jump on board.

[www.aisleauthority.email](https://www.aisleauthority.email) is the place to subscribe if you want to be the best damn wedding ceremony creator in the world.
