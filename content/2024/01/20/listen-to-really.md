Linking to, sharing, telling people about podcasts is a hard problem to solve. If only because I personally do most of my listening while driving.

So I was reminded this morning to link to a project and podcast I've been really enjoying, [@martinfeld](https://micro.blog/martinfeld)'s [Really Specific Stories](https://www.rsspod.net/).

> Really Specific Stories is a part of a broader PhD project, in collaboration with Dr. Kate Bowles and Dr. Christopher Moore at the University of Wollongong. Each episode includes an interview with a producer or listener from a selected tech podcast case study and uses the qualitative method of narrative enquiry to uncover their experiences. Down the line, responses from each interview will be included in a final PhD thesis.

They're all good, and this probably speaks more to my specific brand of nerdery than the quality of the episode, but I've personally enjoyed [@gruber](https://micro.blog/gruber)'s [episode](https://www.rsspod.net/john-gruber), [Marco Arment's](https://www.rsspod.net/marco-arment), [john Siracusa's](https://www.rsspod.net/john-siracusa), [Stephen Hackett's](https://www.rsspod.net/stephen-hackett), [Casey Liss's](https://www.rsspod.net/casey-liss), [Manton Reece's](https://www.rsspod.net/manton-reece), [Daniel Jalkut's](https://www.rsspod.net/daniel-jalkut), [Jean Macdonald's](https://www.rsspod.net/jean-macdonald), and [Andrew Canion's](https://www.rsspod.net/andrew-canion) episodes .. that said, they're all great recordings about a very specific time in history, the time that tech podcasts became a thing.
