I can’t escape this idea of what ‘taste’ is, as discussed on the [Ezra Klein show](https://overcast.fm/+oiPX6OddI/04:07).

> I like to think about taste not as something that’s not just about consuming a thing or enjoying a thing superficially on a day to day basis, but instead almost making it part of yourself.
