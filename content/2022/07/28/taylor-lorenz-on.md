[Taylor Lorenz on why you don't want the old Instagram back](https://taylorlorenz.substack.com/p/you-dont-want-the-old-instagram):

> "It's tempting to think that if Instagram simply reverted to a previous design or reinstated a chronological feed, that would somehow bring us closer to the people we care about. But we don't forge personal connections by sharing or commenting on highly personal public-facing photos that are permanently displayed on a grid anymore. These days, intimacy is fostered through features like DMs, group chats, or ephemeral posts to Close Friends."
