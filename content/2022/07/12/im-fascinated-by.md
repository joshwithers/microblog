I'm fascinated by this idea: [Vickrey auction as price discovery mechanism](https://kevinlynagh.com/notes/pricing-niche-products/)

> "If you run a sale at $X, the most you can learn is that Y people were willing to buy there. Actually, not even that: If your entire inventory sells out, you learn only that at least that many people were willing to buy — you don’t learn how many would’ve bought your kit, had it been in stock."
