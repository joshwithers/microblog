> God is love but love gets weird
> Said the flea to the ant in the devil’s beard
> We are passengers here, and it’s as we feared
> That God is love but love gets weird
 
> Yes, God gets weird and so does love
> Said the flea to the ant and gave him a shove
> And came down upon him from above
> Crying, God gets weird and so does love
 
> Well, Weird got Love and God got Weird
> And in the monstrous morning there appeared
> The very thing we’ve always feared
> That God is nothing, but love gone weird
