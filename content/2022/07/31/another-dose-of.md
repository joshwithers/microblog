Another dose of inspiration for my family’s 2023:

Seneca:

> “Everybody agrees that no one pursuit can be successfully followed hoping I by a man who is preoccupied with many things.”

Warren Buffett:

> “The difference between successful people and very successful people is that very successful people say ‘no’ to almost everything.”
