The co-founder of podcast host Anchor has written about his perceived issue with podcasting in the [Standards Innovation Paradox](https://mignano.medium.com/the-standards-innovation-paradox-e14cab521391), and James Cridland [has responded that it hasn’t remained stagnant in its 19/21 years](https://blog.james.cridland.net/the-standards-innovation-paradox-is-it-real-a1987188c5e9).

The most prominent issue I see in podcast standards today would be in forming a distinction between a serial show, an episodic show, or a one-off show, like a feature story or a documentary. Serials and episodic shows are covered already in the RSS, but I could see a type of audio story that is a single “episode” of either fiction like a feature film, or a single story like a documentary.
