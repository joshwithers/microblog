One of my earliest memories is from Expo 88 in Brisbane. I remember the intense display of future technology - or at least what they thought it would be - and it sparked something in me that still rages today.

The wonder of how amazing tomorrow could be.

Thanks to Anthony for sharing this [Expo 88 blog post from the National Archives](https://www.naa.gov.au/blog/together-well-show-world-telecom-expo-info) in [The Sizzle newsletter](https://thesizzle.com.au) today for bringing all those nerdy memories back.

One of these photos has a very cool Josh Withers in it, I'll let you play Where's Wally to figure out which one. The other is from the NAA.
