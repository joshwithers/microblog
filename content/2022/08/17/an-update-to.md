An update to the whole ['my photos were stolen and published in a book at Kmart" story](https://joshwithers.blog/2022/06/28/off-to-the.html):

Before beginning any legal proceedings I sent them an invoice for a "plucked from the sky" number to license my photos to them. $2,200 an image, $8,800.

The publisher freaked out, took the book off the shelves, and called me to apologise. They ended the phone call with a commitment to come back with a compensation plan, but so far nothing.

$2,035 to send a lawyer's letter on a hope and a prayer that they respond.

It'd be a lot more money to take it to court.

Sitting here wondering how to respond, so I sent a text. Thank god autocorrect softened the blow.
