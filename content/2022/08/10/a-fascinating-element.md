A fascinating element of modern web design is that developing/producing for the open web has actually gotten harder, not easier.

I remember the promise of Microsoft FrontPage, Apple's iWeb, Macromedia Dreamweaver, that normal people could just make websites then upload the boring old HTML, CSS, and images to a directory on a web-facing file server and bam you're online.

But today you've either got Squarespace, Wix, Wordpress.com or installing Wordpress on your own server - but then shit gets weird. Like someone I know was all excited for [Astro](https://astro.build) and I look at the website and in the hero image area is the instruction to "npm create astro@latest" and I have no idea what that means?

Where's the cool and hip web content creator of today?
