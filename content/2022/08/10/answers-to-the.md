Answering the most common questions I’ve been asked about Britt and I moving to Mexico with our two kids:

1. **When do you go?** October 10, 2022, then I come back for a month’s work around Australia Nov-Dec and then I’m back in Mexico before Christmas.
2. **Where will you go?** I’ll let you know when we get there. We’re going to float around and do some housesitting gigs and try to find our place in the country. Honestly, it might not even be Mexico in the end. The goal isn’t to go to Mexico, the goal is to leave our normal routines and life, and Mexico seemed like as good as any place to get a residency visa. But of course, we are going to Mexico and I always think of the people that move to Australia and go to Sydney, I reckon those internationals miss out. I don’t want to end up in the Sydney of Mexico, or the Surfers Paradise. I’d love to end up in the Tugun of Mexico, somewhere small and beautiful and unique.
3. **When will you come back?** We’ll let you know when we’re back.
4. **How will you afford it?** [Please book our house, The Tugun Pause, on Airbnb](http://tugunpause.au) … plus I’d love for [my photography](https://unsplash.com/@joshwithers) to mean something financially - you can buy prints at [art.josh.withers.co](https://art.josh.withers.co). Also, we're still running the Elopement Collective and also mentoring celebrants at The Celebrant Institute.
5. **What about the cartels?** What about the snakes, spiders, crocodiles, and dropbears in Australia? Mexico is a really big nation, the whole place isn’t Narcos. I would encourage you to develop a wider view and taste of the world if you think that Mexico is all drug cartels and people smuggling.
6. **Why Mexico?** Why not?
7. **What will happen to our existing businesses?** We’ll still lead and operate [The Elopement Collective](https://withers.co/elopementcollective ) remotely and I’m still in partnership with Sarah at [The Celebrant Institute](https://celebrant.institute) so my celebrant training and mentoring efforts will continue. Being a celebrant, that’s on ice for a season. Consider it a sabbatical.
8. **Why?** The last two years have destroyed us. This is an effort to take back who we are, who we want to be, and what kind of childhood we want our kids to have. We’ve lost more than our accountant could count through this pandemic, and we’re still on the same hamster wheel. I tried changing the hamster wheel to real estate, but the truth is I needed to actually get off all hamster wheels.
9. **Will you do weddings in Mexico?** I’m currently without a work visa in Mexico, so no, but I’m exploring options. Nothing will really matter until I reach my goal anyhow.
10. **What’s your goal, seeing as though you just mentioned it?** My goal is to not know what to do tomorrow. When I don’t know what to do tomorrow, I’ll allow myself to start planning for the next season with Britt and the girls as a team.

Finally, if you’ve gotten this far you probably care about us as a family and are interested in our story. I’m fairly whelmed with the state of social media’s business models, algorithms, data abuse, and advertising these days so I’m publishing and sharing everything here [on the blog first](https://joshwithers.blog). If you’d like a weekly digest of everything shared here, throw your email into [the subscribe form here](https://joshwithers.blog/subscribe). One day if enough of my community is subscribed here I might even just delete all the social media accounts.
