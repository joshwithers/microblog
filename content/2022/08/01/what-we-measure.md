[Byrne Hobart, in The Diff](https://www.thediff.co/p/is-everything-getting-old):

> "If actors are getting older and the music we listen to is getting older, it may be because TikTok stars, Twitch streamers, and Roblox creators aren't being counted among entertainers, even if they have a similar-sized audience. One thing that drags down the average age of Fortune 500 executives is when tech startups with young founders go public, but many of those startups don't have the revenue to qualify for the Fortune 500, even if their market cap puts them in the S&P."

This is the kicker, this is where the story is going. What we measure isn't always what matters:

> "Revenue is a lagging measure of impact, just as box office results are an output from fame."

What else are we measuring that doesn't matter as much as something we're not measuring at all?
