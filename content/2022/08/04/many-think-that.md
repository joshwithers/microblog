Many think that "the elites" or "the media" are pushing an agenda. They're not, it's actually worse. They're just giving us what we want so they can sell it to us and become wealthier.

Heck, if I was them, I'd do it.

Seth Stephens-Davidowitz in Everybody Lies:

> Many have viewed American journalism as controlled by rich people or corporations with the goal of influencing the masses, perhaps to push people toward their political views. Gentzkow and Shapiroâ€™s paper suggests, however, that this is not the predominant motivation of owners. The owners of the American press, instead, are primarily giving the masses what they want so that owners can become even richer.
