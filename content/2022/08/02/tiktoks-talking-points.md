It almost seems like TikTok is the great globalist company we've all been waiting for, to save us from the boredom of our everyday lives, and to connect us - not with our friends - but with some kind of massive data store in China that I am totally sure is totally ok and nothing to stress about at all, ya know.

TikTok's public relations talking points [via Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/tiktok-master-messaging-pr-playbook-china-music-1849334736):

- downplay the parent company ByteDance
- downplay the China association
- downplay AI
- TikTok is a global company
- The TikTok app doesnâ€™t even operate in China
- TikTok is highly localised in its experience and operations, which means ... insert country here ... has a lot of independence in the day-to-day operations of the platform

insert everything is fine gif
