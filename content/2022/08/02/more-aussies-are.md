[More Aussies](https://stockhead.com.au/news/we-asked-5000-aussies-where-theyll-stash-cash-over-the-next-2-years-and-it-got-weird/) - 18% - are going to be investing in crypto in the next 2yrs than real estate - 17% - so it's going to be a pretty good 2yrs for A Current Affair. In fact, I might invest in ACA, they're going to have some great li'l ozzy battler ripped-off stories.
