One of the best things about the internet is how you are distincitly awards how few people are listening to you.

For a decade I worked in an industry where we broadcast from soundproof rooms playing music and talking excitedly under the guise of everyone listening to us.

Here on the internet we have verifiable proof that most people aren’t listening.

So if you feel alone here, you’re not. But then you weirdly, kind of, really are.
