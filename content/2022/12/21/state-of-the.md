Waiting in an airport lounge for a flight to Dallas after wrapping up all my wedding bookings in Australia I thought I'd answer a few questions.

{{< youtube abt6nRvz5EM >}}

Matt asked for Tequila ratings.
Mike asked Why Mexico?
Kristie asked why people fly their celebrant around the world for weddings, why not get someone local?
Dan asked What's the best low-key wedding I've done. Steele demanded an answer.
Chantell asked how often I meet with my couples to do personalised ceremonies I can do without a script.
Luke asked about any time saving tips in business.
Mel asked if I was quitting weddings now?
