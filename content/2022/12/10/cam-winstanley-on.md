<p>Cam Winstanley on Read Only Memory writes about the making of what I still consider <a href="https://readonlymemory.vg/the-making-of-dune-ii/">the ultimate real time strategy game, Dune II</a>;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Dune II did a great job of hitting the hot sand running, not only creating a genre but also working as a piece of stand-alone entertainment&#8221;</p>
