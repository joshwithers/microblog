[Elon Musk sentiment is slowly swinging negatively](https://www.crikey.com.au/2022/05/30/dogecoin-jackson-palmer-elon-musk-cryptocurrency-bubble/), but in a Trump-like fashion, where it’s not so much about a swing, but a widening, gaping, divide between camps.

A divide that I would argue isn’t healthy, despite what anyone thinks of Musk - or Trump. Deep cultural and societal divides are unhelpful because the issue stops being the issue, and the divide becomes the issue.

I’m more and more convinced that everyone having the same size microphone and font on the internet is a bad idea.

But how do we come back from it?
