Three collected thoughts on what the world, all this around us, is:

> "As you become an adult, you realise that things around you weren't just always there; people made them happen. But only recently have I started to internalise how much tenacity *everything* requires. That hotel, that park, that railway. The world is a museum of passion projects."

– @collision

> "Everything requires maintenance to avoid decay, and this ongoing cost is commonly underestimated and unappreciated by the inexperienced, ambitious, or distracted. Hence the virtue of focus and humility."

– @saylor

> "That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader, once you discover one simple fact, and that is that everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you'll never
be the same again."

– Steve Jobs
