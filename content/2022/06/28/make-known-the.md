Craig Mod to Kai in [Dense Discovery 194](https://www.densediscovery.com/issues/194):

> “It’s easy to be seduced by the world of potentiality. A book is always greatest before it’s written. You are intoxicated by what it can be. That’s very dangerous. You want to kill those seductions as quickly as possible, and one way to achieve that is fast iteration.

> Make known the unknown; murder your fantasies.”
