From my boy @JayT0pp's [email](https://jaytopp.com/optin1635405785072):

> "The tourist seeks out culture because in our world culture has disappeared into the maw of the spectacle. Culture has been torn down and replaced with a mall or a talk Â­show. Because our education is nothing but a preparation for a lifetime of work and consumption-because we ourselves have ceased to create."
