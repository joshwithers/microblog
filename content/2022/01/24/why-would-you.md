At a wedding recently I heard my mate [Hutcho](http://www.chrishutchisonweddings.com) belt out an old school banger with more energy and passion than the original artist could of. I jokingly asked afterward, "why do people make new music?" There is so much good music, how do you even get the guts to release a new song and meekly tell the world that you've made new music despite there being so much good music.

Then once you actually make new music, you're hoping that the algorithmically-driven music industry today accepts your offering and feeds it to the masses, so much so that you can put food on the table.

Then I read about the actual state of the music industry. [Ted Gioia writes a few days ago](https://tedgioia.substack.com/p/is-old-music-killing-new-music):

> "All the growth in the market is coming from old songs. The 200 most popular tracks now account for less than 5% of total streams."

And if you enjoy reading about the death, and rebirth, of pop, you should read [Adam Singer as well.](https://adamsinger.substack.com/p/pop-is-dead-and-no-one-cares).
