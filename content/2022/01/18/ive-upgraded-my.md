I've upgraded my MacBook this week to a new MacBook Pro, and a friend asked me how it was.

I said it's unnoticeable, like a good marriage celebrant, or a good real estate agent should be. That good that you don't notice.

When your computer is slow you notice, and you moan about it. When your celebrant isn't confident and delivering a great ceremony, you notice it and joke about it at the reception, and when your real estate agent is a dodgy one, you really notice, and tell all your mates.

My hope is that I'm that good that you don't notice. That I'd be like my new MacBook, so fast, efficient, and plain old good, that you don't notice how good until you think about all the other computers you've used and you realise you've got a real powerhouse of a computer in front of you.
