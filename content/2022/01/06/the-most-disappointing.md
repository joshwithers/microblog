The most disappointing element of modern society is the insistence that all stories (including the news, and celebrity or sport stories) must be completed as soon as possible so we can establish tribal battle lines and figure out if our tribe is winning or losing.

Most stories require hours, if not weeks, or years to bake in the story oven.

It’s highly likely that the stories you’re reading or hearing are actually half-baked and require a lot more time in the oven.

Reject half-baked stories. Reject the need for every story to have a tweet or post attached to it. Embrace slow stories where the storyteller has spent time researching, listening, asking, and they’re delivering a well baked story.

Not some bullshit your mate or a politician tweeted.
