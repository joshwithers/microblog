In 2022 I want to be a lot more deliberate about my inputs. Garbage in, garbage out. I'm continuing to craft my newsletters and subscriptions, [detailed on my inputs page](https://joshwithers.blog/inputs/). Plus I'm now documenting [books I want to read](https://joshwithers.blog/want-to-read/), [books I am reading](https://joshwithers.blog/currently-reading/), and [books I have read](https://joshwithers.blog/finished-reading/).

Small atomic changes should put make sure I'm walking down the right track.
