I don't like a lot of what I see on Instagram Stories.

[Nick Catucci says the same in Embedded this week](https://embedded.substack.com/p/im-a-better-friend-without-instagram?r=ilth&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web):

> "Instagram Stories had been an IV drip of validation for the past five years, and giving myself permission to live my life not as a constant performance, but for myself, has been liberating. It also means I’m not viewing other peoples’ performances, either, which has brought another unexpected benefit: I’m a better friend."
