I missed this [New York Times piece on my hometown](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/12/world/australia/global-warming-climate-adaptation-coastal-queensland.html), Mackay in North Queensland, about how the mayor is almost single-handedly trying to turn the community around on climate change.

> "Over the past year, Mr. Williamson, a fifth-generation Mackay local, has tried more outreach and education, meeting frequently with residents to discuss why the trees are needed, and whether a lighter mix of vegetation might be allowed for partial ocean views."

If Mackay was going to be in the New York Times I always thought it would be because they ship about 100 million tonnes of coal out of the region every year.
