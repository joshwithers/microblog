Thinking about Citipointe Christian College in Brisbane this afternoon …

> “Bless those who persecute you. Don’t curse them; pray that God will bless them. Be happy with those who are happy, and weep with those who weep. Live in harmony with each other. Don’t be too proud to enjoy the company of ordinary people.

> **And don’t think you know it all!**”

‭‭An excerpt from Romans‬ , chapter 12:14-16‬ from the New Living Translation.
