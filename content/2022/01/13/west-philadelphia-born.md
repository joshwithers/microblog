Morgan Cooper made a fan-trailer of a dramatic reboot of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air in 2019:

Will Smith saw that video and now there's a real trailer and a real show!

That's one of the best things about this new world without as many gatekeepers, and falttened lines of communciation and promotion. You can just have an idea, run with it, and see where it lands.

Will Smith talks about that idea in this video about the new reboot:
