[Om Malik](https://om.co/2022/01/12/can-we-ever-become-post-social/) on the lethal and constant feeling of self-importance we walk around with:

> "With all the conversation of breaking free from big social platforms, owning your own digital identity, and being independent, I have been asking myself: how can all of us who have slowly become online performance artists ever be post-social?"

Since March 2020 I've thought a lot about what it means for us to think we're so self-important and what that means for us living in a community with a virus like the spicy cough.

I'm sure it's not only me, but the moment a sense of self-importance enters my soul I start feeling sick. This photo of a chicken with a mullet often helps me get over myself.
