I've got an old friend and we share ideas with each other. Then years later we share a news article about how someone "stole" our idea.

James Clear's distinction between our sharing ideas and working on them, stings:

> "If you're not working hard, ideas donâ€™t matter. The best idea is worthless without execution. If you're already working hard, ideas are crucial. Most effort is wasted on mediocre ideas."
