In Praise of Conspiracy Theories, [David Perell](https://ckarchive.com/b/zlughnhz932k):

> It’s easy to hate on conspiracy theories, but what are the best arguments for taking them seriously?

> Here's one: At a recent dinner, we started talking about John F. Kennedy assassination theories. One guy remarked that historical conspiracy theories are worth studying because they illuminate so much about the culture of the time.

> Studying the JFK conspiracy theories is a fun way to learn about the tension between Cuba and America, America’s rivalry with the KGB, the won’t-stop-at-anything political motivations of Lyndon B. Johnson, the mafia’s influence, and the power of America’s Central Intelligence Agency.
