One of the wisest things I was ever taught about radio broadcasting ... and life ... was that you needed learn the rules so you understood them so you could break them.

Learning that rules were so you could understand not so you could be be limited, broke my mind and made me, me.

I feel like [Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/2021/12/recipes-2/) was on a similar vibe in this post:

> One sort of job requires people to follow a recipe. Another, better sort of job requires people to understand the recipe. If you understand it, that means you can change it. You have resilience and insight and the leverage to make it better.
