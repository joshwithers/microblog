Today, on the 683rd day of March 2020, we won our first Covid wedding cancellation court case, a court hearing I attended from the carpark of a service station in Maryborough which had erected a statue of Ned Kelly in front of it. A weird culmination.

The first six were frustrated contracts which meant the contract was basically torn up and the judge had to make a decision as if they were a "man on the Clapham omnibus" which is pretty much the common law definition of the pub test.

Today, our contract stood up and was not frustrated, and the couple had cancelled the contract.

So the real winner in this pandemic is my original lawyer, who I fired after his legal advice when people started cancelling was for us to just refund everyone, something we couldn't afford to do.

Wedding vendors are not wedding insurance, but for the past 683 days we've been treated like it.
