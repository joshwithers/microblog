[Steve Albini to Kurt, Dave and Chris, aka Nirvana](https://news.lettersofnote.com/p/nirvana):

> "I like to leave room for accidents or chaos. Making a seamless record, where every note and syllable is in place and every bass drum is identical, is no trick. Any idiot with the patience and the budget to allow such foolishness can do it."
