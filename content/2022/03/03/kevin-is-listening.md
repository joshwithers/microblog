[Kevin is listening through every album of every band he loves](https://www.kevinsmokler.com/2022/01/25/in-praising-of-listening-through-every-album-by-your-favorite-artist/):

> "Even the great treasure of music can seem dull at times. I’ve found that giving over real considered time to an artist’s work has taught me so much–about art, about creative decisions and really just about how we all get up in the morning and have to make that day happen in a way that it mattered."
