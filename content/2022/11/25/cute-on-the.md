Cute. On [the news that the leap second is being removed](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/19/science/time-leap-second-bipm.html), Rev. Pavel Gabor, an astrophysicist and the vice director of the Vatican Observatory Research Group in Tucson, Arizona said that,

> "atomic timekeeping was just one example of how the world was becoming incomprehensible to the average person, and that scientists had a responsibility to help people feel in control of their lives."

And he went on to say,

> “I think sensitivity to this mistrust of elites, mistrust of experts, mistrust of science and institutions, that’s something that’s a very real problem in today’s world,” he said. “And let’s not contribute to it.”

I'm so looking forward to the world returning to normalcy and peace in 2035 when the leap second is removed.
