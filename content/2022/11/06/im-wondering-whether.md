I'm wondering whether "stay in your medium lane" is good advice for Elon Musk and Twitter today?

I think about Instagram starting as a still photo medium and how I like it less as it has changed lanes. Facebook started as a "friend-to-friend connection" medium, and I like it less as Adam Mosseri has obsessed over Reels and videos.

Twitter started as, and mostly still is, a text medium.

The human brain likes to catalogue and silo things. Twitter is a textual medium, and all of us on it love that about it.

If Twitter wants to evolve to take on YouTube and Facebook and leave text behind, that will be its death knell. Not headwinds in the marketplace, but the fact that those of us that like to read and write text, want to connect and share in a place that champions reading and writing text.

That's why I[moved my writing and sharing](https://micro.blog/joshua) to [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/joshua) when it launched. [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) champions text and text sharing, whilst also encouraging you to own your content/text.

If anything was going to take Twitter's place today, in my humble opinion, it would be [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog), because it has a business plan, it has a network, by design it's healthy and good for the soul, but it champions the reading and writing of text.
