In the Gold Coast Bulletin today @AnnWasonMoore nails it making the [biggest losses/mistakes the Gold Coast has experienced](https://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/news/gold-coast/ann-wason-moore-shares-the-gold-coasts-biggest-mistakes-including-letting-go-of-the-fishermans-wharf-and-magic-mountain/news-story/8dfffcb7297d0885ba72f35d026dff84). But Iâ€™ll add one more: the Indy 300. It was so much more interesting than Supercars, and Aussie driver Will Powers still dominates!
