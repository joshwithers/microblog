I met Charles Wooley when I was in line to be his producer on what’s now called the Triple M regional radio network.

Smart guy, good interviewer, wasn’t going to leave Tasmania for a big radio job, so they built out the Hobart studios to accomodate him.

I never took the gig, but I was impressed that someone could love where they live so much to the chagrin of a radio job.

In the [Sunday Tasmanian today](https://www.themercury.com.au/news/opinion/wooley-local-government-is-a-vital-element-in-our-functioning-democracy/news-story/402800411d25ef6fc3af73f6b0b10f83):
