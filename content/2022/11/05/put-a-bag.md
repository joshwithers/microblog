> Put a bag of cookies in the break room and it might sit for days.

> Open the bag and leave it out, and within an hour, all the cookies will be gone.

> We are happy to take a tiny slice off the thing that's being shared, but we hesitate to open the bag.

> The same is true with all of the initiatives in our culture. Design, movements and ideas are all trapped, waiting to be opened, and then the rest of us will happily pile on.

> Open the bag.
