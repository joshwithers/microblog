Why don't we use the word "swashbuckling" more? It's a very cool word.

The MacOS dictionary defines swashbuckling as an adjective as "engaging in daring and romantic adventures with bravado or flamboyance" and as a noun "daring and romantic adventure."

It came to mind as I read Margaret Sullivan's book, Newsroom Confidential, and she recalled the story of Jeff Bezos addressing the Washington Post staff:

> “Even in the world of journalism, I think the Post is just a little more swashbuckling. There’s a little more swagger. There’s a tiny bit of bad-assness here at the Post.” After some applause and laughs from the exuberant crowd, Bezos elaborated on those words with some context: “Without quality journalism, swashbuckling would just be dumb. Swashbuckling without professionalism leads to those epic-fail YouTube videos. It’s the quality journalism at the heart of everything. And then when you add that swagger and that swashbuckling, that’s making this place very, very special.”

My new life goal is to be described as swashbuckling.
