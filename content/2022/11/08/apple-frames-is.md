Over seven years since Workflow first graced the Apple ecosystem - since then being acquired by Apple and renamed Shortcuts which makes it so easy to Google for information about - it's still a little-known tool on the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

My favourite shortcut - it's the ultimate shortcut - created by the ultimate Shortcuts guy, Federico Viticci at Macstories, is [Apple Frames](https://www.macstories.net/ios/apple-frames-3-0-completely-rewritten-support-for-iphone-14-pro-and-dynamic-island-new-devices-multiple-display-resolutions-and-more/). The shortcut has just been updated to its third version and is ever more powerful and works even better.

You feed the shortcut one or more screenshots you've taken on the device, and it inserts the screenshot into an Apple device frame, so the resultant image carries more context. Examples beneath of some quick single screenshots, and three iPhone screenshots shared together in one image.

[Get the shortcut here](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/11e1638ad1ec45abb01d99a12cb36f31).
