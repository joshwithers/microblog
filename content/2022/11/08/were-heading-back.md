We’re heading back to Hawaii in mid-January and it got me thinking about the last time I was there and I created a marriage ceremony across the bay from Aerosmith’s Steven Tyler house.

I’ll never know if Steve witnessed me in my element on Maui, but they’ve never officially said what I Don't Want to Miss a Thing was about …

Anyway, this is just your regular reminder that I make epic marriage ceremonies from Ipswich to Iceland and everywhere between.
