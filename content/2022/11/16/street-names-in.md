Street names in Baja are wild, in that they barely exist. To prove my residence/address I need to show an electrical bill. So this street a few blocks from our house is hilariously named.

It's named after a gardener who still lives in that street, and drinks multiple litres of alcohol a day. His nick name is "Litre" or in Spanish "Litro". So a gringo who loves him had a street sign made, attached to the pole at the start of the street, now everyone calls it Litro Street.
