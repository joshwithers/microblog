Things people have said to me tonight as I DJ a wedding I wasn’t even supposed to DJ:

Young female guest: Do you know who is playing right now? (Naughty By Nature *and I instantly age 20 years*)

Young male guest: What Spotify playlist is this?!? (I chose songs individually because it’s just more fun that way)

Middle aged female guest during a Missy Elliot song and just after September by Earth, Wind, and Fire have played: can you play more songs for us oldies, we don’t like this music and no-one’s dancing (I’m looking at a full dance floor).

A tip if you’re attending a wedding, save your requests for your drive home.
