I acquired a new lens for my Canon EOS R5 camera today, the new Canon RF 24mm f/1.8. I'm generally a fan of a long lens, like my favourite 70-200mm. If I had a pack horse with me (and endless money) I'd have the [$20,000 600mm](https://www.digidirect.com.au/canon-rf-600mm-f-4l-is-usm-lens) on me at all times. But for family photos, portraits, some landscapes, and vlogging you need something a little wider.

Britt loves a 35mm, me not so much. I've enjoyed my little 50mm, but it's not wide enough, in that it's not wide at all. I trialled the RF 16m but that's too warped and wide.

When Canon announced the new RF 24mm I had three positive thoughts:

1. The main camera on iPhones today is a 26mm equivalent, and the iPhone is where I fell in love with making photography
2. With an R5 I can punch in with a 1.6x crop, which is a 38mm equivalent, so I can still get a tighter shot and although it's cropping the 44.8 megapixels from the sensor, there's still plenty to spare.
3. My photo kit had gotten too big, particularly if we're travelling.

So I sold my 16mm, 35mm, and I'm about to sell my 50mm, and I'll be left with this 24mm and my 70-200.

How does the Canon RF 24mm compare to an iPhone 12 Pro 26mm? Here's two moments captured by both, and edited in Lightroom on the iPhone with my friend Bec's [Story Keeper presets](https://www.storykeeper.co/presets):
