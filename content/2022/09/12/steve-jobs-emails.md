> I grow little of the food I eat, and of the little I do grow I did not breed or perfect the seeds.

> I do not make any of my own clothing.

> I speak a language I did not invent or refine.

> I did not discover the mathematics I use.

> I am protected by freedoms and laws I did not conceive of or legislate, and do not enforce or adjudicate.

> I am moved by music I did not create myself.

> When I needed medical attention, I was helpless to help myself survive.

> I did not invent the transistor, the microprocessor, object oriented programming, or most of the technology I work with.

> I love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being.
