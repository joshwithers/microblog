Someone on Hacker News found an unbelievable Wikipedia article about the [Athletics at the 1904 Summer Olympics – men's marathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletics_at_the_1904_Summer_Olympics_–_men%27s_marathon)

> "While Fred Lorz was greeted as the apparent winner, he was later disqualified as he had hitched a ride in a car for part of the race. The actual winner, Thomas Hicks, was near collapse and hallucinating by the end of the race, a side effect of being administered brandy, raw eggs, and strychnine by his trainers. The fourth-place finisher, Andarín Carvajal, took a nap during the race after eating spoiled apples."
