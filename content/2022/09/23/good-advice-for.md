Good advice for people who have been Optus customers since 2017, I have been one, is to enact a credit freeze. [IDCARE has a fact sheet on freezing your credit](https://www.idcare.org/fact-sheets/credit-bans-australia#:~:text=You%20can%20apply%20for%20bans,to%20their%20terms%20and%20conditions).

A credit freeze means no-one, including you, can apply for credit in your name.

Talking about caring about identification, an Australian institution like that not using a .au domain name is a little triggering IMHO.
