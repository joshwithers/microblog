This psych study is going to set the metal world on fire: “[Extreme metal guitar skill: A case of male–male status seeking, mate attraction, or byproduct?](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-76738-001)”

> “there is evidence that playing music increases male attractiveness”

> “Extreme metal is a genre that is heavily male-biased”

> “musicians in this genre heavily invest their time in building technical skills (e.g., dexterity, coordination, timing), which raises the question of the purpose behind this costly investment”

> “This study explores the idea that heterosexual male metal guitarists are motivated to invest heavily in getting good at guitar to primarily impress other men.”
