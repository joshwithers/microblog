Patagonia Founder Gives Away the Company to Fight Climate Change, [writes David Gelles in The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/14/climate/patagonia-climate-philanthropy-chouinard.html):

> “In some ways, the forfeiture of Patagonia is not terribly surprising coming from Mr. Chouinard. As a pioneering rock climber in California’s Yosemite Valley in the 1960s, Mr. Chouinard lived out of his car and ate damaged cans of cat food that he bought for five cents apiece. Even today, he wears raggedy old clothes, drives a beat up Subaru and splits his time between modest homes in Ventura and Jackson, Wyo. Mr. Chouinard does not own a computer or a cellphone.”
