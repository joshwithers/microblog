[Vinay Prasad, Professor, Hematologist, Oncologist, Health policy researcher, on the weird place we're at with Covid vaccines today](https://sensiblemed.substack.com/p/double-standards-the-atlantic-tells):

> "The media coverage of vaccines and side effects is awful. They lack a philosophical framework and are unmoored. This article nicely shows how that is the case. Whether they choose to improve is beyond me. They have too much allegiance to the Biden administration, and have failed American boys as a result."
