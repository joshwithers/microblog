Started this morning in a cheap Brisbane hotel with a 4am alarm and a 6:05am flight at gate 16, which became a 6:05am flight at gate 26, which transformed into a 7am flight back at gate 16, and it’s just changed it’s haircut so it’s now a 7:15am flight at gate 16. I’m excited to see the journey this Qantas flight takes.

Hwoever, this most definitely is the wrong week to be breaking in new Blundstones.

It’s 2022 and there’s no real solution for blisters yet. How is this?
