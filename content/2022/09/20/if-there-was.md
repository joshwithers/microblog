If there was a game that could drag me into purchasing a Nintendo Switch, it'd be [Monkey Island](https://returntomonkeyisland.com).

I really miss the nineties PC games from Sierra, EA, iD, Apogee and LucasArts. Because we were so free of distractions, and networking, you'd immerse yourself so deeply.
