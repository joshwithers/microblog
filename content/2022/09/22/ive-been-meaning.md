I’ve been meaning to link to [Down Round](https://anchor.fm/downround) for a while, but most of my podcast listening is while I’m driving and that’s not a time that I’m blogging. Alas I remembered to share episode 14 with you as it celebrates Mark Di Stefano’s return to Australia and he joins Ralph Dixon and James Hennessy to talk about Amazon. [Really good episode, A++ would listen again](https://overcast.fm/+7MYjfk8s0).
