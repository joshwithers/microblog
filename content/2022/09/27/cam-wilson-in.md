[Cam Wilson in Web Cam](https://view.mail.crikey.com.au/?qs=02dae29843b0cdd86a14384dc21bc6657854f856deee99df3248ec81461539d6966e26587bafea5d8709ca98c45f2f1ddfc4ba5e885576badbf8c5026988de914c9346098b2d8e4244081051e3a3528e) on crime reporting:

> “There’s a lot of good criticism of crime reporting. It fosters systemic racism. Crimes are reported on because of the novelty factor rather than merit. A lack of follow-ups means articles rarely show the full story of a crime (including if charges are dropped). It tends to uncritically share the narrative of police, even though they are unreliable narrators. And above all else, it publicises one of the lowest moments of someone’s life and probably makes it harder for them to right the ship.”
