[Andrew Greene reporting](https://twitter.com/andrewbgreene/status/1574546067588513792?s=46&t=JF7EzscuQv91K2-uzXyYlg) on the Optus data thief (they like to call the person a hacker):

> WARNING - do not click on latest link from alleged Optus hacker. IT security experts confirm it “tries to use drive-by and explicit download techniques to install executable files - this appears to be an attempt to capitalise on the publicity from the hack to setup a future hack”

Optus’ lack of leadership in this data crisis will be its legacy.
