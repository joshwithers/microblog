Larry Miller, NYU, in [The Future of Music podcast on The Verge](https://overcast.fm/+QN1ou_JdI) hosted by Ariel Shapiro:

> "The magnitude of most hits is smaller."

> "We've also noticed that the amount of music being uploaded and the vast majority of the new music is never listened to."

> "The streaming services, including TikTok, are great at breaking a track. They're less great at breaking an artist and a career."

Music has been such a shared experience - shared joys, shared sorrows - it's such a valuable part of our cultural fabric that I wonder what the current state of music means for the fabric yet to be spun.

If Iâ€™m by myself I rarely listen to music, but with friends in the car, at concerts, or even sharing links to songs amongst us is where the songs make sense.

Is the divestment of the collective music experience another pointer towards a divided people?
