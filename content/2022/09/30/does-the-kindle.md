My reading device of choice has been a Kindle Oasis (2nd model) I picked up at a Best Buy in Vegas in December 2017. It fast became my favourite little gadget. The Oasis was last updated in July 2019 - and Britt owns that model. It's got a warmth setting and a smidge larger battery, but it's basically the same.

So I've been waiting patiently for an Oasis upgrade or replacement. In the meantime I just have to recharge my Kindle every two days instead of every two months, no big deal ya know.

New Amazon product of the month, the [Kindle Scribe](https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/28/23375663/amazon-kindle-scribe-e-ink-tablet-stylus-event-price), has been drawing lots of [Remarkable 2](https://www.theverge.com/21403489/remarkable-2-e-ink-paper-tablet-review) comparisons, and avid readers of this blog might remember I was a [big fan of my Remarkable](https://joshwithers.blog/2020/12/06/can-the-remarkable.html).

Since that review a few things have changed:
- I sold my iPad Pro because the Apple Silicon MacBooks married with a Remarkable 2 was a happier solution.
- I've now sold my Remarkable tablet because I've been downsizing in preparation for living in Mexico and travelling around.
- My Kindle Oasis remains unchanged, but desperate for replacement.
- I've also bought an iPad Mini because size - but it's a terribly underpowered machine so that's being relegated to "TV on airplanes and buses" duty with my kids.

So does the Scribe fit the Remarkable-loving, iPad-replacing, Oasis-upgrading dream I've been looking for?

It seems to be a really close fit, with one exception. The Oasis would have been one of the largest Kindles produced at 7", but the Scribe is a 10.2" device, almost matching the Remarkable, and I think that's too big to lay in bed reading a book from.

So we wait.
