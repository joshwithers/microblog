The world is starting to reflect on 2020-2022 and what everyone did, and how we reacted, and I'm not reading many pieces that are all in with their support.

This is from [Dr Raya Leibowitz, Israeli oncologist, a scientist (MD/PhD) and the head of a medium-sized oncology institute in Israel](https://sensiblemed.substack.com/p/towards-yom-kippur-an-israeli-physician):

> "I am writing so not to forget the response of governments and societies to the COVID-19 pandemic over the last 2.5 years; responses that were, for me and many others, dystopian. During this time, Israeli society, as I knew it, has dramatically changed for the worse."

The thing I'm most interested in is how I even feel hesitant to share this piece because of the negative feedback I receive from my community for not being all-in on the response to the pandemic.

The article is a personal story of a doctor who held not-so-mainstream views and how her community rejected her. If the net effect of Covid is that you're alive but living with division in community, living with fear and hatred of others, I think I'd rather be dead.
