[Tim Burrowes reports on Rupert Murdoch's "remarkable" 70-year career](https://www.unmade.media/p/rupert-murdoch-goes-platinum-and) in the media:

> He created a newspaper empire which has shaped the culture of the English speaking world.

> He made newspaper paywalls work when nobody else thought he would succeed.

> He saw streaming coming and sold most of his TV and film interests to Disney at the top of the market.

I personally find the influence of News Corp and the Murdochs disgusting and intolerable, yet I can also look at that 70-year body of work and say it's remarkable, amazing and will most likely never be repeated in a similar scale. Which is most likely a good thing.
