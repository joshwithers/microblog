- There's a difference between good tacos and just tacos, good tacos are more likely to be in less-fancy buildings without flashy signage.
- Processing your Mexican temporary residency is much harder than they make it sound.
- Really should have learned more Spanish before getting on the plane.
- Even a nice Hilton hotel is still, in the end, just a hotel.
- It's amazing how terrible a car can be to still be listed for sale here. I looked at a car for 60,000 pesos (just under $5,000AUD) and I think someone was murdered in it but it wasn't cleaned.
- Horses, livestock, dogs and other animals all just roam free here. Must be tough for fencers to not be needed.
- Lawns don't exist here unless you're in a fancy place. It'd be hard to move here if your identity was built on how good your lawn is.
- Very few Australians are here or have visited here. Many people are surprised to hear we travelled so far.
- Should've stopped for a night or two in Los Angeles. 26 hours door to door was a lot for two toddlers.
- Always buy bottled water.
- Oysters taste different here. Bad different.
- I had to drive on the other side of the road for the first time in three years in the presence of a Mexican man whose car I was test driving. He must have spent the whole time wondering why a person who drove this bad wanted to buy a car.
- Money transfers internationally are never as quick as you'd imagine, especially over a weekend.
- There's little consistency between different offices of Mexican authorities. There's very much a local spirit in the decisions they make.
- We love it here.
- It's quite hot.
- Buy a good pram and travel cot, they're worth their weight in gold.
- Pack light, you don't need all that stuff.
- There are no Ubers, Didis, Lyfts or taxis in Todos Santos.
