Andrzej Stasiuk:

> “It is good to come to a country you know practically nothing about.

> Your thoughts grow still, useless.

> In a country you know nothing about, there is no reference point. You struggle to associate colors, smells, dim memories.

> You live a little like a child, or an animal.”
