Some inherent problems in the internet of 2022, in my humble opinion:

1. Everyone is too exposed to everyone else, for example, it's wild that anyone and everyone can read these words I'm typing. It's beautiful and wild, but ultimately we aren't born ready to be so exposed. There's the smallest number of celebrities that have successfully been in the public spotlight for their whole lives and come out unharmed, and even those that keep a positive public identity have conspiracy theories made up about them (Hi, Tom Hanks). I don't think we were made to be in community with the whole planet.
2. Many people want to be more highly exposed, and believe that they are not exposed enough, and think everyone else needs to be exposed to them, their thoughts, their art, their work. We don't. I'm actually ok with not knowing what Kanye West thinks at the moment.
3. What happens if the extremists don't live in the light but decamp off to the shadows? Do they become a problem for society? Do they impose on your and my own safety?
