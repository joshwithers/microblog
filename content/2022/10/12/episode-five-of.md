[Episode five of Who’s Gonna Save Us with Saul Griffiths](https://www.abc.net.au/radio/programs/whos-gonna-save-us/05-better-call-saul/101453306), paraphrased by Kai in [Dense Discovery](https://www.densediscovery.com/issues/209):

> “A typical Australian suburb spends about $4m on petrol and diesel per year. That creates half a job at the local petrol station which is mostly selling sugar and tobacco anyway – that’s like three things that can kill you in one store! Anyway, if everyone is driving electric vehicles and producing their own electricity, those $4m will stay in the community. We know from spending behaviour that 55% of that money will be spent locally, creating a huge number of jobs. Not just energy jobs, but it’ll be paying for better bakeries, new classrooms, a fresh coat of paint for the sports club, etc. I don’t think we ever really thought about just what a screamingly good thing that would be for every community.“
