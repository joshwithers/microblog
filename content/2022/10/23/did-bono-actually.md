Did [Bono](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/oct/22/bono-memoir-birth-of-u2-itunes-album-live-aid-mullet) actually encourage Tim Cook on services and subscriptions when they worked out the deal to give away Songs of Innocence through iTunes?

Tim Cook in 2014:

Tim Cook in 2022 (paraphrased):
> “Services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services.
