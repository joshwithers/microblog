It was kind of fitting for one of my last weddings before we head to Mexico to be at Weddings at Tiffany's. One of my first was there as well, and it's one of my most memorable weddings because of how the groom thanked and encouraged me after the ceremony.

He said "I thought you were going to be a really shit celebrant, but you were awesome!"

Over the last 14 years I hope I've equally positively surprised you with my "me-ness" whilst also been a solid rock you can rely on when you get married. It has been, and will be, such an honour to hold that moment for you, I've never taken it for granted. That's why we're taking this sabbatical, because I'd like to do this celebrant thing forever.

A guest at yesterday's wedding is still upset she couldn't book me for her wedding six years ago because I was booked then, and I'm getting similar vibes from people emailing about 2023 weddings at the moment.

I'll be back - especially for tomorrow's wedding at Sanctuary Cove, and the couples I'm coming back from Mexico to marry in November/December - but trust me when I say I don't think I could carry on marrying people next year after the last three without something breaking, so we're taking the courageous act of taking a break instead of being forced into one.

People always say this about their own job, but I know they're lying, because I have the best job in the world. Thank you for giving it to me.
