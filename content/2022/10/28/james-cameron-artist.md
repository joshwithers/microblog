This [New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/10/26/man-of-extremes) profile of Director, James Cameron, hit home with this line: 

> “He sees himself as essentially outside and other and alone; he bites the hand that feeds.”

Thats a solid mark of an artist, that they create from the outside-ness, the loneliness, and in doing so they bit the hand that feeds.

Just yesterday a photographer friend and I were lamenting this feeling in ourselves. It’s why I found it so easy to transplant to a new country, maybe why I feel so at home with an airline ticket.

So if you feel alone, you’re not alone, despite the fact you truly are.
