My anxiety is of the opinion that none of you really care about me, contacting me or enjoying our family travels, if that's so, please cease reading and thank you for confirming my deepest fears and anxieties. But, if you do wish to stay in contact with me and enjoy our photos and stories of lands far away, I have four notes for you:

1) Every email address you have for me is wrong unless it is my name then an @ symbol then my last name, finishing with a .co ... delete all other addresses from your address book or contacts app. Email remains my personal favourite place to communicate, please email whenever and whatever you like.

2) If you must instant message with, or call, me I would prefer for it to happen on iMessage or FaceTime, contacting me with the same email address. If you refuse the beauty and glory of the apple ecosystem I am unsure how we can stay in contact. WhatsApp is ugly, Telegram is full of Russian spam, none of you use the Signal app, plus it's linked to my phone number which I'll get to in point three.

3) My phone number will be trashed, and in the future, I'll have other phone numbers that I'd prefer to not have to keep any longer than internet access is required. I wish to de-link myself from phone numbers in general but the world seems to think they are important.

4) Although I am often tempted to post and share on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and whatever is hot online, my heart longs for a time when we take control of the stories we read, when we personally decide what we get angry or happy about. So my contribution to this effort is to write, photograph, publish, and share on my own personal blog [joshwithers.blog](https://joshwithers.blog) ... there's also a weekly digest of what's been published there and you can get it by visiting at [joshwithers.blog/subscribe](https://joshwithers.blog/subscribe) to subscribe.

If you wish to engage in the same kind of blogging I am, I can highly recommend [micro.blog](https://micro.blog).

I publish, photograph, write, broadcast and share online to satisfy something inside of me that wants to contribute to the fabric of our society, to the story of our generation, and this is me doing that. If you think that's a bit weird, you'll love my blog.
