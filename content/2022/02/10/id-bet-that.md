I'd bet $10 that the image was created on a Mac and saved without a .jpg extension. Can't wait for the link that proves this and the headline is about how a Mac broke a Mazda over the air.

[Ars Technia](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/02/radio-station-snafu-in-seattle-bricks-some-mazda-infotainment-systems/): Radio station snafu in Seattle bricks some Mazda infotainment systems.

> "The problem, according to Mazda, was that the radio station sent out image files in its HD radio stream that did not have extensions"
