I impulse purchased a Stem Player a while back because I convinced myself I needed something this weird in my life. Now Iâ€™m probably one of like ten people in Australia [who will be able to listen to Kanye West's new album](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/18/22940748/donda-2-stem-player-kanye-west-exclusive-music). What a time to be alive.
