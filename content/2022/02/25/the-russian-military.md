The Russian Military website is down with [HTTP error code 418, which means it is a teapot](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/418) #nottheonion

> "The HTTP 418 I'm a teapot client error response code indicates that the server refuses to brew coffee because it is, permanently, a teapot. A combined coffee/tea pot that is temporarily out of coffee should instead return 503. This error is a reference to Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol defined in April Fools' jokes in 1998 and 2014."
