Chuck Klosterman [on the 90s](https://www.vulture.com/article/chuck-klosterman-interview-the-nineties.html):

> "It feels as though the 1990s weren’t just the last decade of the 20th century but sort of the last decade, period — the last decade with a fully formed and recognizable culture of its own."
