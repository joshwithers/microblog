[Eric Karjaluoto on the fallacy of individual wins](http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/blog/look-for-waves/) and benefiting from the one force that every great business success has leveraged: The Wave:

> Henry Ford didn’t invent the automobile; he rode the assembly-line wave.

> Mary Kay Ash didn’t invent cosmetics; she rode the direct-sales wave.

> Andrew Carnegie didn’t invent steel; he rode the building wave.

> Steve Jobs didn’t invent computers; he rode the digital wave.

> Anita Roddick didn’t invent soap; she rode the ethical business wave.

> Larry and Sergey didn’t invent search; they rode internet wave.

> Chip Wilson didn’t invent stretchy-pants; he rode the yoga wave.

> Jeff Bezos didn’t invent book sales; he rode the ecommerce wave.
