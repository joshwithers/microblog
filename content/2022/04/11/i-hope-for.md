I hope for a future where our thoughts, our conversations, our relationships, and our transactions are not handled by a handful of the largest companies on the globe.

I just think it's a nicer world that way.

So I blog at micro.blog and that shares to some places, and I manually share to Facebook and/or Instagram sometimes, but ultimately I'd love to become acquainted with you outside of a corporate algorithm.

One way to achieve that is email. Apart from Google's every attempt to ruin the experience for us, you subscribe to an email list and it appears in your inbox. You can reply to me, I can reply to you. It's good.

If you like what I share, and you'd like to get it in an automatic weekly digest, chuck your email address in here [joshwithers.blog/subscribe](https://joshwithers.blog/subscribe/).
