This is weird, but I need your help finding a ball.

KMart used to sell these little massage balls that look like a virus emoji ðŸ¦ . About 12cm in diameter, and really hard plastic. Theyâ€™ve discontinued the product and Iâ€™ve bought about 4 similar ones from Amazon but theyâ€™re soft rubbery plastic and not what I need.

I need hard plastic, something I can dig my heel into and bring peace to my plantar fasciitis.
