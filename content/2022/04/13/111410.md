If I’m making photographs for fun - aka not for money - I’m often shooting with a 41 year old lens that was passed on to me from my aunty, a Minolta MD 50mm f2 strapped onto the front of my Canon EOS R5.

There’s nothing technically special about the lens, but I love that it’s seen so much of the world. Plus I like the images it makes

But because it's a manual focus only lens, it's a nice trick if any images are in focus.

Recently started playing with Topaz Sharpen AI and that software really helps me where my manually focusing fingers fail me.
