A friend asked “Thoughts on Musk Twitter?” in a message, I replied, and thought, that should be a blog post:

The man’s not an idiot, and Twitter hasn’t thrived as a public company. He’s one of the few people who could buy it without antitrust issues whilst also actually uses the actual product and has an interest in it.

I reckon it’s a potential net-positive.

Worst case scenario: Twitter fades into obscurity as it has been for a while.

Best case scenario: Maybe there’s a social media platform with a better platform than “we know everything about you and use that to sell ads.”

As for the people who think Elon could of spent the money better, spending other people’s money is easy, spend your own on charity.
