Someone recently asked me what makes me who I am, why would people invite me to fly around the globe to be their marriage celebrant?

I think it’s because I care. I believe that your marriage matters, that it’s a once in a lifetime kind of love, and I think your wedding ceremony matters. But I think your marriage should be better than your wedding. And I think that the best part about a wedding is the ceremony.
