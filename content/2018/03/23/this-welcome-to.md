This 'welcome to the Gold Coast street lights sign/artwork' is no better when you're looking at it straight on and in the air ... I hate to jump on bandwagons, but this is a pretty supreme waste of public funds. I love the Gold Coast, I'm 100% behind #GC2018, but this sign is silly on so many fronts.
