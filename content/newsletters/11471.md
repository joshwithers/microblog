<p>Private equity <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/17/permira-completes-squarespace-acquisition-after-upping-bid-to-7-2b/">completes another stroll</a> through the web-hosting world (after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24262232/matt-mullenweg-wordpress-org-wp-engine">WP Engine</a>), and thus today begins (or perhaps continues) the enshittification of Squarespace.</p> 
<p><img src="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2024/d0961508f6.jpg" alt="Techcrunch screenshot" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p> 
<p>As my friend Ori said:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>“Nothing like PE to ruin something.”</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Private equity seriously is <a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/the-long-bloody-lineage-of-private-equitys-looting-798597a4fa30">ruining</a> so many beautiful things on the internet (see <a href="https://bendingspoons.com">Bending Spoons</a>) because founders and creators often struggle make a living online, they seek growth and revenue and find it hard, so they sell to PE because PE can make money online: gut the product, layoff staff, raise prices.</p> 
<p>Welcome to capitalism, you and I with our little savings can't stand in the way of it, but in the light of Squarespace going to PE, I'm reminded:</p> <ol> <li>Two of our business websites being on Squarespace</li> <li>The other one being on Wordpress (but not WP Engine)</li> <li>And finally, of my own personal philosophy to POSSE and build things yourself.</li> </ol> 
<p><a href="https://kottke.org/24/10/0045453-posse-post-on-own-site">Jason Kottke shared</a> this a few days ago from <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/posse/">Molly White</a>:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>“The short-term solution to these problems is a little-known acronym called POSSE. Short for Post (on) Own Site Syndicate Elsewhere, it’s not a protocol or even a piece of software, but rather a philosophy.”</p> </blockquote> 
<p>There’s never been a better time to build your own house on the internet—your own website and blog—and never have to worry about Squarespace, Meta, Google, or Apple anymore. You’ll no longer need to worry about being cancelled or banned. Prices going up, or products being gutted. You get to choose your destiny. Your home is your home.</p> 
<p>How to?</p> <ol> <li>Learn HTML.</li> <li>Learn Markdown.</li> <li>Learn to host and build your own website and blog, your own home on the Internet.</li> </ol> 
<p>For HTML, check out the beautifully made <a href="https://htmlforpeople.com">HTML For People</a>:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>“HTML isn’t only for people working in the tech field. It’s for anybody, the way documents are for anybody. HTML is just another type of document. A very special one—the one the web is built on.”</p> </blockquote> 
<p>And for Markdown, it’s just plain boring text with a few additions. The best place to start IMHO is with the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">document that started it all in 2004</a>:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>“The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.”</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Search online for other Markdown tutorials, there'll be millions, but just start learning to write and format in an open language, one that isn't owned by Microsoft (.docx) or others.</p> 
<p>From there, start investigating building and hosting your own website, like the one you’re reading this on. Hosted on <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.Blog</a>, built using <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>, and <a href="https://tiny.micro.blog">Tiny Theme</a>.</p> <hr> 
<p>In 20 years, you’ll be thankful that you started building your own house online today.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2024/10/17/i-dont-want.html" class="microblog_permalink">Oct 18, 2024 ↓</a>

I have records of virtually every text I’ve sent since I was in college but no idea how to find the ones that meant something.

We do have fights (oh, yes, we do), but they do not threaten our foundation. They deepen it.”</p> </blockquote> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2024/10/20/lucy-schiller-in.html" class="microblog_permalink">Oct 21, 2024 ↓</a> 
<p>Lucy Schiller in the Columbia Journalism Review’s <em><a href="https://www.cjr.org/business_of_news/final-flight-airline-magazine-united-digital.php">The Final Flight of the Airline Magazine</a></em>:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>The idea of the airline magazine reaching everyone possible. An in-flight magazine is “for you, it’s for your mother, and it’s for your daughter,” she said. “Everyone has to be able to read it. It crosses generations with its appeal. Most people are aware the audience is broad.” So: the opposite type of product, really, from the personalized digital content tooled and retooled by increasingly specific customer data. “It can’t be niche,” Carpenter continued. “It can’t make people feel separated from it. It’s not going to be political or religious. It’s going to be inspiring, positive. Airline magazines don’t write bad reviews. We don’t interview someone to make them feel dumb. It’s all about putting positivity out into the world.”</p> </blockquote> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2024/10/20/we-dont-have.html" class="microblog_permalink">Oct 21, 2024 ↓</a> <h3>We don't have to live this way</h3> 
<p>I'm reading Kirsten Power's <a href="https://kirstenpowers.substack.com/p/the-way-we-live-in-the-united-states">Substack on how life in the USA is not normal</a>, whilst visiting the USA, and I can not only agree, but say that many parts of the thesis apply also to Australia in a uniquely Australian way.</p> 
<p>Kirsten:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>I began to notice a learned helplessness in the United States, where people don't revolt at the notion of a college education costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. I wondered why so many people treat it as completely normal that we have GoFundMe campaigns to help people pay for life-saving medical care that their health insurance won't cover.</p> 
<p>I watched as people on social media claimed it was "pro-labor" to tip a person for ringing up your order at a food or coffee chain rather than demanding the multi-millionaire (or billionaire) owner of that company pay their employees a living wage (as is the norm in Europe, where tipping is not expected and the owners of the restaurants and stores are typically not among the uber-wealthy).</p> 
<p>I realized there are other places in the world (not just Italy) where life isn't about conspicuous consumption and "crushing" and "killing" your life goals, where people aren't drowning in debt just to pay for basic life necessities. There are places where people have free time and where that free time is used to do things they love — not to start a side hustle.</p> 
<p>I started to have a dawning awareness that we don't have to live this way.</p> </blockquote> <hr> 
<p>Australia might have a semblance of public health care, and tipping was not the norm (how tf is tipping becoming normalized in Australia is beyond me), but Australian society automatically assumes that everyone wants to be in a race to the bottom where we're overloaded with debt and ambition whilst setting our children up for a life of therapy.</p> 
<p>We don't have to live this way.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2024/10/20/testing-imessages-via.html" class="microblog_permalink">Oct 21, 2024 ↓</a> <h3>Testing iMessages via Satellite in Joshua Tree</h3> 
<p><img src="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2024/wthc4003-1.jpg" width="600" height="480" alt="Auto-generated description: A person is holding a smartphone outdoors, displaying a satellite connection interface with options like messages, roadside assistance, and emergency SOS." style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p> 
<p>So earlier today I was takin the family around Joshua Tree National Park. I took my phone out and realised I had no service but that little satellite icon was there and that this might be my chance to try <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/120930#:%7E:text=Starting%20in%20iOS%2018%2C%20Messages,Tapbacks%20over%20iMessage%20and%20SMS.">Messages via satellite on my iPhone</a>, a new feature in iOS18 available on iPhones 14 and later.</p> 
<p><img src="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2024/sunday-20-oct-2024-221928.png" width="600" height="383" alt="Auto-generated description: Three smartphone screens display satellite connectivity features, showing options for sending messages and accessing services like Find My and Emergency SOS." style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p> 
<p>So you tap 'Use Messages via Satellite' after choosing Satellite from Control Centre list of modes you can enable and disable, the same list that wifi and bluetooth are on.</p> 
<p>I neglected to time it but I'd estimate and say it took two-ish minutes to find a satellite and connect, whilst encouraging me to move around, move left and/or right, and perhaps find an area with more open skies.</p> 
<p><img src="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2024/sunday-20-oct-2024-222007.png" width="600" height="578" alt="Auto-generated description: Two smartphone screens display satellite communication features, one for sending location and the other for roadside assistance." style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p> 
<p>The app gives you notification that you're connected via satellite and you have four options:</p> <ul> <li>Messages</li> <li>Find My</li> <li>Roadside Assistance</li> <li>Emergency SOS</li> </ul> 
<p>I'd not used any of the satellite features previously available so I tapped in to have a look out of curiosity.</p> 
<p>But the new one was Messages so I sent the obligatory text message to my friend, Scott, and we had a semblance of success.</p> 
<p><img src="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2024/sunday-20-oct-2024-225023.png" width="600" height="578" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p> 
<p>And although the connectivity isn't good enough for photos, group chats, or even on-to-one chats in any large quantity, I feel confident that if I was out of range in a country supporting Messages via Satellite - currently only U.S. and Canada - that I could deliver emergency text messages, or if nothing else, ask someone to double check that I didn't leave the iron on.</p>
