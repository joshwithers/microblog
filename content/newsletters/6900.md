<p>I can’t escape this idea of what ‘taste’ is, as discussed on the <a href="https://overcast.fm/+oiPX6OddI/04:07">Ezra Klein show</a>.</p> <blockquote> 
<p>I like to think about taste not as something that’s not just about consuming a thing or enjoying a thing superficially on a day to day basis, but instead almost making it part of yourself.</p> </blockquote> <video controls="controls" playsinline="playsinline" src="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2024/image.mov" width="640" height="360" poster="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2024/38d4ec6118.png" preload="none"></video> <a href="{%20.Permalink%20}">Video</a> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2024/01/15/going-to-bed.html" class="microblog_permalink">Jan 15, 2024 ↓</a>

<p>A little life update: we handed the keys for our Gold Coast home back to the landlord yesterday. Today we’re home-less. I’ve just boarded a flight to Melbourne for a wedding there this weekend, then we’re off to New Zealand for a week, the. Hobart and Sydney.</p> 
<p>What I’m trying to say is don’t post me anything.</p>

<p>This is a <a href="https://skeuomorphic.design/p/from-2-clicks-to-1-click-the-untold">really insightful read</a> by Michael Darius behind designing the iTunes Music Store, wrapping up on the video at the end though, really amazing that an entire genre of store no-longer exists. </p>

<p>Linking to, sharing, telling people about podcasts is a hard problem to solve. If only because I personally do most of my listening while driving.</p> 
<p>So I was reminded this morning to link to a project and podcast I've been really enjoying, <a href="https://micro.blog/martinfeld">@martinfeld</a>'s <a href="https://www.rsspod.net/">Really Specific Stories</a>.</p> <blockquote> 
<p>Really Specific Stories is a part of a broader PhD project, in collaboration with Dr. Kate Bowles and Dr. Christopher Moore at the University of Wollongong. Each episode includes an interview with a producer or listener from a selected tech podcast case study and uses the qualitative method of narrative enquiry to uncover their experiences. Down the line, responses from each interview will be included in a final PhD thesis.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>They're all good, and this probably speaks more to my specific brand of nerdery than the quality of the episode, but I've personally enjoyed <a href="https://micro.blog/gruber">@gruber</a>'s <a href="https://www.rsspod.net/john-gruber">episode</a>, <a href="https://www.rsspod.net/marco-arment">Marco Arment's</a>, <a href="https://www.rsspod.net/john-siracusa">john Siracusa's</a>, <a href="https://www.rsspod.net/stephen-hackett">Stephen Hackett's</a>, <a href="https://www.rsspod.net/casey-liss">Casey Liss's</a>, <a href="https://www.rsspod.net/manton-reece">Manton Reece's</a>, <a href="https://www.rsspod.net/daniel-jalkut">Daniel Jalkut's</a>, <a href="https://www.rsspod.net/jean-macdonald">Jean Macdonald's</a>, and <a href="https://www.rsspod.net/andrew-canion">Andrew Canion's</a> episodes .. that said, they're all great recordings about a very specific time in history, the time that tech podcasts became a thing.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2024/01/20/ten-years-on.html" class="microblog_permalink">Jan 20, 2024 ↓</a> 
<p>Ten years on since we filmed the first season of Married At First Sight, nine years on since it aired, and I still get recognised. Just happened in Footscray.</p> 
<p>It’s wild how being on TV has such lasting brand power.</p> 
<p>Unlike this post which will be seen by two humans, five computers, and a large language model.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2024/01/21/i-dont-know.html" class="microblog_permalink">Jan 21, 2024 ↓</a>

<p>Ben Thompson's interview p<a href="https://withe.rs/6EQl">o</a>dcast with Spike Eskin about radio from 2023 is a really good listen if you have a Stratechery membership.</p>

<p>Marketing is actually part of the product.</p> 
<p>That’s an intangible element of Apple products that is often missed by the Android, Windows, Meta Quest commenters.</p> 
<p>Sure, the other products do “the same things” the Apple products does, but Samsung, Microsoft, Meta, Google marketing is woeful.</p> 
<p>This isn’t an Apple thing, this is a human thing. Some of us just want to be a part of something beautiful and cool.</p> 
<p>An Apple invoice and delivery is not just some plastic and metal, software, and some USB cords. It’s also a story, a narrative that some people with certain taste, would like to purchase.</p> 
<p>And the rest of you can go use your Android, Dell, Meta Quest.</p> </div> </div>
