<p>Thinking about Citipointe Christian College in Brisbane this afternoon …</p> <blockquote> 
<p>“Bless those who persecute you. Don’t curse them; pray that God will bless them. Be happy with those who are happy, and weep with those who weep. Live in harmony with each other. Don’t be too proud to enjoy the company of ordinary people.</p> 
<p><strong>And don’t think you know it all!</strong>”</p> </blockquote>

<p>Yossi Ghinsberg is speaking to my Harcourts team today, this early statement about him reading books during school classes ignoring the teacher captured me all afternoon:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>“No matter what you do, make a story out of it”</p> </blockquote>

<p>Every cricket season I think about the couple I met with who didn’t book me because I didn’t know who the groom was.</p> 
<p>I asked what he “did”, he said “play cricket”, to which I replied, no I mean like a career or a job.</p> 
<p>He replied “I play cricket.”</p>
