<p>Jiddu Krishnamurti:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>The ability to observe without evaluating is the highest form of intelligence.</p> </blockquote> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/07/11/why-the-rush.html" class="microblog_permalink">Jul 11, 2023 ↓</a> 
<p>Why the rush to 5G?</p> <blockquote> 
<p>On a per user basis, a 5G network is cheaper to operate than a 4G one. The technology is easier to maintain and more reliable. It’s not sexy. That’s something that is hard to sell to consumers, but makes a huge difference to telcos. There’s much more to this. The additional capacity may not be a pressing matter in New Zealand right now, but in time there will be more connections and 5G gives carriers headroom to cope with future demand. There may be future apps that can use the speed.</p> </blockquote>

<p>You've heard the phrase "Content is King", coined by Sumner Redstone - the old rich white person behind CBS, Viacom, Paramount, MTV, Comedy Central etc who passed in 2020 - but Bill Gates popularised the idea for the internet back in January of 1996. It's so beautiful and odd to <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2023/content-is-king.pdf">read this essay</a> 27 years on.</p> <blockquote> 
<p>But to be successful online, a magazine can’t just take what it has in print and move it to the electronic realm. There isn’t enough depth or interactivity in print content to overcome the drawbacks of the online medium.</p> </blockquote> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/07/12/when-i-first.html" class="microblog_permalink">Jul 12, 2023 ↓</a> 
<p>When I first went into self-employment over a decade ago now I set up templates for common or transactional emails and I was always aware that I didn’t want an email not from me, yet from me, to not sound like I had sat down and written the letter.</p> 
<p>So I used to write the automated emails from our cat, Stevie.</p> 
<p>Stevie is no longer with us, her liver went south, but she lives on as of this week. I’ve replaced all of our automated emails with ChatGPT-generated emails and yet messages written by Stevie AI. Seeing what ChatGPT/Stevie is writing is amazing and hilarious and really good.</p> 
<p>Consider that my teaser to enquire with me for your wedding, that a cat will send you emails.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/07/12/i-think-i.html" class="microblog_permalink">Jul 12, 2023 ↓</a> 
<p>I think I just accidentally haggled with a vendor in an Italian street market. I thought the fruit cost less than five euros, I gave him five euro., he looked at me and giggled, winked, and points his finger at me and took the money and gave me no change. Is that what haggling is? I’m good at life.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/07/13/the-most-fascinating.html" class="microblog_permalink">Jul 14, 2023 ↓</a> 
<p>The most fascinating, whilst also overwhelming, experience in travel, especially when you undertake it for more than a weekend is 'noticing'. </p> 
<p>Almost every time I notice something I think about what Steve Jobs once said:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>"When you are a stranger in a place, you notice things that you rapidly stop noticing when you become familiar."</p> </blockquote> 
<p>I sincerely love being a stranger. I think that's a common thread in my life, that when I become too known I feel uncomfortable. I feel very comfortable being a stranger in a strange place and rather too uncomfortable being at home.</p> 
<p>I hope I can give my kids the upbringing that would help them feel the complete opposite, but still curious about the world, still desiring to be strangers in a strange place, noticing.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/07/13/does-anyone-else.html" class="microblog_permalink">Jul 14, 2023 ↓</a> 
<p>Does anyone else have weird iPhone storage glitches? I've had this problem for the last maybe 4-5 years where my iPhone doesn't actually know how much storage it has. I've been on a 256GB iPhone for a while now, and Apple Store staff have asked me to backup and restore, I've even started on new installs recently.</p> 
<p>The only thing that normally fixes it is doing a backup to my Mac.</p> 
<p>My gut feeling tells me that there was a time maybe 4-5 years ago where I was loading in RAW images from my camera into iCloud Photo Library and editing with RAW Power and I reckon that they're stuck in the iCloud/phone storage jungle.</p> 
<p>My Mac's Photos library also has this weird thing where it picks 1 or 2 photos that it allegedly cannot upload to the cloud, yet it actually originally got that photo from the cloud (it was uploaded on my phone), and the photo is still in the cloud.</p> 
<p>I'm semi-tempted to burn this 20-year-old .mac/MobileMe/iCloud account to the ground, export everything, and start again. It feels like there's always something small that could be buggy happening ... or is that just how iCloud feels for everyone?</p>

<p>My favourite/least-favourite thing to do when travelling Italy is go to these million year old classical Italian osterias (restaurants) run by the village’s most heralded humans, and ask for takeaway.</p> 
<p>The first reaction from the staff is a blank look on their face, as if I’ve just asked them to murder the weakest member of the wait staff.</p> 
<p>The second thing they do is ask permission from someone in a back room. I assume it’s the pope.</p> 
<p>The third is agree then go searching for takeaway boxes or dishes. I’ve seen them run across the road and get some.</p> 
<p>Finally, after all this I’ll ask for a glass of vino “while I wait” and the same thing happens every time. The young wait staff member comes back and explains that they can’t do takeaway glasses of wine.</p> 
<p>I just wish I could explain to them that we’re dispassionate about disciplining our two and four year olds in restaurants and the world’s just a nicer place if we takeaway.</p> 
<p>But thanks to the magic of Apple Translate and hand gestures we get there in the end.</p>

<p>The most terrifying thing I’ve seen in Italy so far was ten Italian youths aged around 12 years old loudly chanting “gay!” and aggressively geaturing in a way that was a little bit too familiar for this Sarina High School alumni, taunting this young lad who was just laughing in their face!</p> 
<p>He’s either gay and joyfully proud, or not gay and impervious to the bullying that brought earlier generations to their knees.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/07/14/italian-kids-get.html" class="microblog_permalink">Jul 15, 2023 ↓</a>

<p>If I can be really frank, does anyone else “have parents” but honestly really doesn’t have parents relationally/socially/spiritually and when you have a down moment in life you just feel super alone?

<p>This week ahead sees the Australian celebrancy movement celebrate its 50th anniversary.</p> 
<p>50 years ago 0% of Australian weddings were lead by a civil celebrant, today over 80% are. And the entire movement has driven the Australian wedding industry forward to a point where we lead the world’s wedding industry in product, service, brand, professionalism, and creativity.</p> 
<p>For a movement that’s grown from Canberra to the world, thank you Lionel Murphy, Lois D’Arcy, and my celebrant colleagues for making a way for me to make a job that takes me aroundd the world.</p>
