<p>Salon Tom Weston’s Five Rules of Being A Grown-Up:</p> <ol> <li>You must not have anything wrong with you, or anything different about you.</li> <li>If you have something wrong or different about you, you really need to correct it. You need to be able to pass under all circumstances.</li> <li>If you can’t correct it, or change it in any way, you should just pretend that you have. It’s not a problem anymore. Good news!</li> <li>If you can’t even pretend not to have corrected the situation, you should just not show up, because it’s very painful for the rest of us to see you in your current condition.</li> <li>If you’re going to insist on showing up, you should at least have the decency to be ashamed.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/08/15/salon-tom-westons.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-08-15</a> </li> </ol> <hr> 
<p>Muppets magic.</p> <blockquote> 
<p>"I'd save every day like a treasure and then again I would spend them with you"</p> </blockquote> <video controls="controls" playsinline="playsinline" src="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2022/beb777f7c5.mp4" poster="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2022/f71da78b51.png" preload="none" width="640" height="480" alt=""></video> 
<p>Cover of Jim Croce's 'Time In A Bottle' as found on The Muppets in 1977. Also, weirdly, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF6OYq_2Ooc">featured alongside another Muppet in an iPhone ad for the iPhone 6S and Siri</a>.</p>

<p>Running your own business is the most powerful vessel for learning. Theory actualises itself into practical, meanwhile, you've placed a bet, you've made a sacrifice, on the learning.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/08/15/running-your-own.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-08-15</a></p> <hr> 
<p>It’s weird when I hear about people watching the same TV show at the same time as other people because the antennas on a nearby mountain determined it so.</p> 
<p>Its kinda quaint, like calling someone on the phone, or catching a bus cross-country.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/08/15/its-weird-when.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-08-15</a></p> <hr>

<p>My mate Jay has made a documentary about remote knowledge workers, digital nomads, working around the Arctic Circle and I'm pretty damn jealous of those landscapes, the visuals, and the lifestyle! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br24CeADMpQ">Check out the trailer</a>!</p>

<p><strong>Expo 88 is the reason I'm a nerd</strong></p> 
<p>One of my earliest memories is from Expo 88 in Brisbane. I remember the intense display of future technology - or at least what they thought it would be - and it sparked something in me that still rages today.</p> 
<p>The wonder of how amazing tomorrow could be.</p> 
<p>Thanks to Anthony for sharing this <a href="https://www.naa.gov.au/blog/together-well-show-world-telecom-expo-info">Expo 88 blog post from the National Archives</a> in <a href="https://thesizzle.com.au">The Sizzle newsletter</a> today for bringing all those nerdy memories back.</p> 
<p>One of these photos has a very cool Josh Withers in it, I'll let you play Where's Wally to figure out which one. The other is from the NAA.</p>

<p>An update to the whole <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/06/28/off-to-the.html">'my photos were stolen and published in a book at Kmart" story</a>:</p> 
<p>Before beginning any legal proceedings I sent them an invoice for a "plucked from the sky" number to license my photos to them. $2,200 an image, $8,800.</p> 
<p>The publisher freaked out, took the book off the shelves, and called me to apologise. They ended the phone call with a commitment to come back with a compensation plan, but so far nothing.</p> 
<p>$2,035 to send a lawyer's letter on a hope and a prayer that they respond.</p> 
<p>It'd be a lot more money to take it to court.</p> 
<p>Sitting here wondering how to respond, so I sent a text. Thank god autocorrect softened the blow.</p>

<p>View the world through a series of incentives and you’ll find we’re doomed in every direction. Health departments want people to drink less. Tax departments want people to drink more.</p>

<p>As a person born in 1981, the greatest dilemma I face is whether I identify as Gen X or Gen Y.</p> 
<p>I don’t like Gen Whiners, they don’t seem like my kind of people, but then I hear really old people identify as Gen X and I’m sure I’m not that old.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/08/21/as-a-person.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-08-21</a></p> <hr>
