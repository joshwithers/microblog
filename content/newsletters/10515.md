<p>Imagine the monotony of life if the sun slipped away without a whisper, and the skies farewelled the day with no fanfare, leaving the world untouched by the splendour of their daily performance.</p>

<p>My 1994 Packard Bell 486SX 25/33 isn’t that impressive thirty years on but it impressed me in the 90s because it had a the set of matching SVGA monitor and video card. Super VGA my dude. 800x600 pixels, and 24 bit colour, that’s 16,777,216 possible colours per pixel.</p> 
<p>I hypothesised back then that if you wrote a program that simply randomised the colour of each of the 480,000 pixels you could see any image ever - eventually.</p> 
<p>I called it the Face of God idea. That eventually that computer could just imagine and display any image real or otherwise, even the face of God.</p> 
<p>As the <a href="https://www.threads.net/@chriswelch/post/C-8LF4BOSAP/?xmt=AQGzSb6xl99tti8RSDwbazAXgFu-e-DryMeelAy7zNdNfQ">Pixel 9 AI “what is a photo” terror</a> arises this week I’m thinking about it all again. What does it mean when a photo isn’t a photo?</p> 
<p>I wonder if this is the dawn of a new fantastic era of creativity and wonder, or if my favourite means of creativity - photography - has just been hit with a nuclear bomb?</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2024/08/24/wendell-berrys-thoughts.html" class="microblog_permalink">Aug 24, 2024 ↓</a> <h3>Wendell Berry’s thoughts on Technological progress</h3> 
<p>Josh Nadeau, aka Instagram’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/swordandpencil">@swordandpencil</a>, shared these words in a story today and my boy <a href="https://micro.blog/qldnick">@qldnick</a> shared them with me, which is all to say I have intelligent and thoughtful friends and also that I can’t source the original quote. Regardless of those technicalities, I can’t stop thinking about.</p> 
<p>Wendell Berry’s thoughts on technological progress:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>But in general, apart from its own highly specialised standards of quantity and efficiency, “technological progress” has produced a social and ecological decline. Industrial war, except by the most fanatically narrow standards, is worse than war used to be. Industrial agriculture, except by the standards of quantity and mechanical efficiency, diminishes everything it affects.</p> 
<p>Industrial workmanship is certainly worse than traditional workmanship, and is getting shoddier every day. After forty-odd years, the evidence is everywhere that television, far from proving a great tool of education, is a tool of stupefaction and disintegration. Industrial education has abandoned the old duty of passing on the cultural and intellectual inheritance in favor of baby-sitting and career preparation.</p> 
<p>After several generations of “technological progress,” in fact, we have become a people who cannot think about anything important. How far down in the natural order do we have to go to find creatures who raise their young as indifferently as industrial humans now do? Even the English sparrows do not let loose into the streets young sparrows who have no notion of their identity or their adult responsibilities.</p> 
<p>When else in history would you find “educated” people who know more about sports than about the history of their country, or uneducated people who do not know the stories of their families and communities?</p> </blockquote> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2024/08/25/am-i-an.html" class="microblog_permalink">Aug 25, 2024 ↓</a>
