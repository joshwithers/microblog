<p>It's amazing how close Google is to upsetting the iMessage monopoly and I'm betting they'll let go of the opportunity.</p> 
<p>I've just started using Google Chat for a new project and it's actually not terrible. For someone in the Apple ecosystem, it's not far from being as good as iMessage.</p> 
<p>They need a native Mac app that works like a Mac app, and their iPhone app needs to work in with the share sheet API, but it's close.</p> 
<p>They're so busy fighting for iMessage to accept RCS/Google that they'll no doubt miss this opportunity to just put iMessage out of business.</p> </div> </div>
