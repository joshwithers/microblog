<p>Seeing the #SolidarityWithSanna posts reminds me of something that happened 10 years ago next week: Alan Jones and Barnaby Joyce on the radio <a href="http://chirb.it/cw933f">proclaiming that "women are destroying the joint" 1:29 into this audio</a>. Some people struggle with female leadership.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/08/23/seeing-the-solidaritywithsanna.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-08-22</a></p> <hr> 
<p>I’ve created marriage ceremonies in the coldest climates, through Californian deserts in winter, Iceland in winter, New Zealand mountaintops in winter.</p> 
<p>Today in the Blue Mountains was the coldest I’ve ever felt, and in all those other weddings I wasn’t wearing a puffer jacket.</p> 
<p>It cold.</p>

<p>Wow, I didn’t know this but you can use your $50 Qantas voucher like a power-up mid-flight so the flight attendant doesn’t smash into your elbows with the drinks cart, or to be allowed to push the seat in front of you back up when the passenger puts it down.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/08/24/wow-i-didnt.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-08-24</a></p> <hr>

<p>“In June of 1460, news reached Pope Pius II of an orgy which had recently taken place in the gardens of Giovanni di Bichis’s palace in Tuscany.

<p>"If he had known to say to the board some version of “Q2 deliverables were only at 10% of forecast, but because of our LTV:CAC ratio and percentage of pipeline in mid-market, we should see full quota attainment by Q4,” maybe his problems wouldn’t have been so serious."<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/08/26/evan-armstrong-supposes.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-08-26</a></p> </blockquote> <hr>

<p>Rob Hardy on non-coercive marketing:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>"The key ingredient in non-coercive marketing is the golden rule. We should market to others the way we'd want to be marketed to ourselves. Non-coercive marketing places full authority and trust in people. It creates the conditions under which they can make empowered decisions for themselves, and do so in their own time. It doesn't seek to persuade, manipulate, or pester people into a decision that's already been made for them. It merely opens new doors, tells the truth about what's behind those doors, then surrenders the outcome, trusting that the right people will step through when they're ready."<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/08/28/rob-hardy-on.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-08-27</a></p> </blockquote> <hr>
