<p>Shalom Auslander:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>I was thinking about sex the other day because I was having a really depressing day, and a dead body had been found by the pier, and as I was taking my son to school and waiting at a traffic light, a homeless man in a mad fury began circling my car, shouting and spitting, and it felt like forever before the light turned green and I thought I needed to get my mind settled so I went to a bookstore and all the books were about how to succeed in business, and about how to work even more, and there was a whole section about how to use the ancient philosophy of Stoicism to get ahead in your corporate career, and outside the bookstore people were sleeping on the sidewalk and there was a store where shoes were 30% off and still cost two-hundred dollars and I stopped to write at a coffeeshop where people were arguing about politics and war and fascism and genocide and a woman at the table beside me was talking loudly at the people on her laptop screen, who were talking loudly at her about the client and the presentation and the need for a more aggressive social media marketing plan, and as I drove home the billboards and buses were covered with advertisements for movies, and the people in the advertisements were giants, and they were perfect, and they were revered and admired like Gods and most of them were actually truly awful people who shouldn‚Äôt be admired at all and so by the time I got home, I crawled into bed and I closed my eyes and a moment later, I heard a little girl outside my window, and she was crying and shouting and her mother asked her what was wrong and she shouted, at the top of her little lungs, ‚ÄúEVERYTHING TODAY MAKES NO SENSE!‚Äù and I thought that must have felt really good, I would love to scream like that right now, I would love nothing more than to scream ‚ÄúEVERYTHING TODAY MAKES NO SENSE!‚Äù and how that would make me feel better than sex, better than the best sex better than all the sex in the world, and that‚Äôs why I was thinking about sex the other day.</p> </blockquote> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2024/06/09/in-my-happy.html" class="microblog_permalink">Jun 9, 2024 ‚Üì</a>

<p>I like writing, I like reading, I enjoy running a sustainable and fun business, and I like getting email letters on the topic, so I made one called Aisle Authority.</p> 
<p>My pitch is that it‚Äôs a short daily letter to the best wedding creators in the world. </p> 
<p>The stats say that most people scroll on, but I‚Äôm hoping maybe one other person who likes reading encouraging daily things about being a wedding creator might like it too - <a href="https://www.aisleauthority.email/archive/but-i-dont-know-your-new-address/">read today‚Äôs letter and subscribe</a>.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2024/06/09/easy-like-sunday.html" class="microblog_permalink">Jun 9, 2024 ‚Üì</a> 
<p>Easy like Sunday Melbourne Airport morning</p>
