<p><strong>A weird celebration: we won our first Covid court case</strong></p> 
<p>Today, on the 683rd day of March 2020, we won our first Covid wedding cancellation court case, a court hearing I attended from the carpark of a service station in Maryborough which had erected a statue of Ned Kelly in front of it. A weird culmination.</p> 
<p>The first six were frustrated contracts which meant the contract was basically torn up and the judge had to make a decision as if they were a "man on the Clapham omnibus" which is pretty much the common law definition of the pub test.</p> 
<p>Today, our contract stood up and was not frustrated, and the couple had cancelled the contract.</p> 
<p>So the real winner in this pandemic is my original lawyer, who I fired after his legal advice when people started cancelling was for us to just refund everyone, something we couldn't afford to do.</p> 
<p>Wedding vendors are not wedding insurance, but for the past 683 days we've been treated like it.</p>

<p><strong>West Philadelphia born and raised, and now rebooted, much more dramatically</strong></p> 
<p>Morgan Cooper made a fan-trailer of a dramatic reboot of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air in 2019:</p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WAfJpyBgcgA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> 
<p>Will Smith saw that video and now there's a real trailer and a real show!</p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rQ1uG91Bbls" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> 
<p>That's one of the best things about this new world without as many gatekeepers, and falttened lines of communciation and promotion. You can just have an idea, run with it, and see where it lands.</p> 
<p>Reflecting on the original show, there's obviously a darker storyline underneath the lighthearted primetime television show, but the 90s were never ready for that.</p> 
<p>Will Smith talks about that idea in this video about the new reboot:</p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dnr0QwHVJpg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>My mate @scotty<em>mcdonald knows Brisbane better than you, and he's writing an email about it called <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/scottymcdonald">Brisbane is Weird</a> and you ought to subscribe.<br>

<p>“I used to think the top global environmental problems were biodiversity loss, ecosystem collapse and climate change. I thought with 30 years of good science we could address those problems, but I was wrong.
The top environmental problems are selfishness, greed and apathy – and to deal with these we need a spiritual and cultural transformation and we scientists don’t know how to do that.”</p> </blockquote>

<p><a href="https://om.co/2022/01/12/can-we-ever-become-post-social/">Om Malik</a> on the lethal and constant feeling of self-importance we walk around with:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>"With all the conversation of breaking free from big social platforms, owning your own digital identity, and being independent, I have been asking myself: how can all of us who have slowly become online performance artists ever be post-social?"</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Since March 2020 I've thought a lot about what it means for us to think we're so self-important and what that means for us living in a community with a virus like the spicy cough.</p> 
<p>I'm sure it's not only me, but the moment a sense of self-importance enters my soul I start feeling sick. This photo of a chicken with a mullet often helps me get over myself.</p>

<p>I missed this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/12/world/australia/global-warming-climate-adaptation-coastal-queensland.html">New York Times piece on my hometown</a>, Mackay in North Queensland, about how the mayor is almost single-handedly trying to turn the community around on climate change.</p> <blockquote> 
<p>"Over the past year, Mr. Williamson, a fifth-generation Mackay local, has tried more outreach and education, meeting frequently with residents to discuss why the trees are needed, and whether a lighter mix of vegetation might be allowed for partial ocean views."</p> </blockquote> 
<p>If Mackay was going to be in the New York Times I always thought it would be because they ship about 100 million tonnes of coal out of the region every year.</p>

<p>Proposal: Let’s drop the metaverse, and go all in on the meatverse. Less virtual reality meetings, more steak.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/01/15/proposal-lets-drop.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-01-15</a></p> <hr> <blockquote> 
<p>"As soon as you decide to do without planes, you realise how they impose their limited way of looking at things on you. Oh, they diminish distances, which is handy enough, but they end up diminishing everything including your understanding of the world. You leave Rome at sunset, have dinner, sleep a while, and at dawn you are in India. But in reality each country has its own special character. We need time if we are to prepare ourselves for the encounter; we must make an effort if we are to enjoy the conquest. Everything has become so easy that we no longer take pleasure in anything. To understand is a joy but only if it comes with effort, and nowhere is this more than in the experience of other countries. Reading a guidebook while hopping from one airport to another is not the same as the slow, laborious absorption- as if by osmosis- of the humours of the earth to which ones remains bound when travelling by train. </p> 
<p>Reached by plane, all places become alike- destinations separated from one another by nothing more than a few hours flight. Frontiers, created by nature and history and roots in the consciousness of the people who live within them, lose their meaning &amp; cease to exist for those who travel to and from the air-conditioned bubbles of airports, where the border is a policeman in front of a computer screen where the first encounter with the new place is baggage carousel, where the emotion of leave taking is dissipated in the rush to get to the duty free shop- now the same everywhere"</p> </blockquote>

<p>When Britt and I were dating we lived in different cities the whole time as I travelled for radio work (Port Macquarie, Mackay, Cairns, Sydney, Brisbane) so we spent heaps of time at night on the phone.</p> 
<p>We’d go outside and ask each other if we could see the moon.</p> 
<p>Ten years on we have a daughter named Luna.</p> 
<p>And we named her sister Goldie so we could have our sun and our moon.</p>

<p>In 2022 I want to be a lot more deliberate about my inputs. Garbage in, garbage out.

Plus I'm now documenting <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/want-to-read/">books I want to read</a>, <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/currently-reading/">books I am reading</a>, and <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/finished-reading/">books I have read</a>.</p>
