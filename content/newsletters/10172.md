<p>I've just been named the number one Asia-Pacific photographer who made zero dollars from their passion in the month of July but had a lot of fun doing it. I'd like to dedicate this award to my wife and children who roll their eyes every time dad gets the camera out.</p>

<p>Amazing on two notes.</p> 
<p><img src="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2024/708e027158.jpg" width="450" height="600" alt="Apple Vision Pro on display at Apple Carindale" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p> 
<p>Amazing technology to experience today in real life, not in a YouTube video or a TED Talk, especially considering the poor demo I received from the Apple Carindale kid who clearly had no interest in technology, the future, Apple, or immersive computing.</p> 
<p>Secondly, amazing on where we’ll be a few years from now. If we’re here today, 2034 computing will be beyond our comprehension.</p> 
<p>A notable missing piece is Apple’s native support for 360 photos. The VisionOS platform is out-of-the-box made for 360 photos, but they can’t be experienced on any Apple platform without third-party apps.</p> 
<p>The setup I received was uncomfortable on my head at first, but some strap adjustment and getting used to it brought comfort eventually.</p> 
<p>Apple Store staff in Carindale are not well-trained in the device, and there’s clearly an apathy around the unit that sits firmly at the feet of the high price, meaning that none are selling.</p> 
<p>This is clearly the future. The Apple Vision Pro, but smaller, lighter, faster, better.</p> 
<p>I also think that there’s a big opportunity to start capturing life—like weddings and children—in immersive photography and videography today, so that in 20 years, when we’re all wearing these, we can look back on our 2024 memories and see them immersively. It’s a remarkably different experience from current photography and videography.</p>
