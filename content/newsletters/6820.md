<p>Disappointed this hasn’t come to pass yet </p>

<p>A Brisbane based <a href="https://www.instagram.com/joinflashback/">crew</a> have delivered on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joinflashback/flashback-a-camera-for-the-small-moments/">their Kickstarter promise to deliver a "camera for the small moments", the Flashback Camera</a>. It's a digital film camera, or a film-like digital camera more to the point.</p>

<p>I'm an avid Kickstarter backer, but especially for cool gadgets like this, and it was a pleasure to unpack.</p> 
<p>The idea is to take the point-and-shoot disposable film camera vibe to a digital setting, mainly for the purposes of getting off our phones, disposing of cameras a lot less, and making memories.</p>

<p>I don't have a full review in me, instead, a reflection on having used it for a week: it's a lot of fun and a beautifully made product.</p> 
<p>I have but one issue, probably the same one that everyone who has ever clicked the shutter on their iPhone then instantly been able to share and edit the photo.</p> 
<p>In an <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joinflashback/flashback-a-camera-for-the-small-moments/posts/4000934?ref=ksr_email_backer_project_update_registered_users">update</a> today the makers have expanded on the feature I find most annoying. That at the end of the arbitrary digital film roll of 27 photos it takes about 48 hours for the photos to "develop":</p> <blockquote> 
<p>The processing done to develop your photos is currently too intensive to run on a mobile device. Over the last 2 years, we developed our own effects. In particular, our method to generate film grain is complex. Often, "film grain" effects are based on adding random digital noise, but true film grain is fundamentally different. Analog images are composed of grains, not pixels, and our method follows this closely. Our vision for this product has always been to stay true to the analog world, and we've worked hard to never compromise on that. If we were satisfied with simple filters, we could run them inside the app, but we continue to believe that our current setup is the most flexible in providing the best possible photos from this camera.</p> </blockquote>

<p>Personally, I think there would be greater customer satisfaction if that 48 hour time period was minimised to the actual required time to process, and ultimately that could be brought on to the device. I think the iPhone CPU has proven itself to be apt at processing photos.</p>

<p>It would be nice if the processed photos had better metadata as well, like orientation of photo, date and time that was correct, that the flash even if enabled accidentally by fat fingers wouldn't fire in full sun, and ultimately this last one is just me being really nerdy: GPS co-ordinates of photos so the captured memories end up in iCloud Photo Library memories.</p> 
<p>Here's some demo photos take over the weekend in Exmouth and the Gold Coast ...</p>

<p>The <a href="https://fs.blog/">Farnham Street</a> email:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>A different take on what makes us feel so busy, stressed, and anxious.</p> 
<p>As a rule, the larger your surface area, the more energy you have to expend maintaining it. Of course, when most of us think of surface area, we think of the area of a rectangle or how much grass we have to mow. But there is a surface area of life, and most of us never realize how much it consumes.</p> 
<p>If you have one house, you have a relatively small surface area to maintain (depending on the age and size of the house, of course). If you buy another one, your surface area expands. But it doesn't expand linearly - it expands slightly above that. It's all the same work plus more.</p> 
<p>Friends are another type of surface area. You have a finite amount of time to spend with friends before you die. The more friends you have, the less time you can spend with each one individually.</p> 
<p>Money is another form of surface area. The more money you have, the more you have to keep track of different types of assets and investments.</p> 
<p>When your surface area expands too much, you hire people to help you scale. Assistants, property managers, family offices, etc. They're scaling you - but they're also scaling the surface area of responsibility. This, of course, only masks the rapidly expanding surface area by abstracting it.</p> 
<p>Beliefs are another type of surface area.</p> 
<p>The thing about surface area is that the more you have, the more you have to defend and maintain. The larger your surface area, the more you are burdened with mentally and physically.</p> 
<p>If you think in terms of surface area, it's easy to see why we are so anxious, stressed, and constantly behind.</p> 
<p>We feel like we need more time, but what we're craving is more focus. What we need is a smaller surface area.</p> 
<p>Your surface area becomes part of your identity. She's the 'busy person' with her hand in every project. He's the guy with four houses.</p> 
<p>Competition can drive expansion. Most people want a bigger house to compete with someone else who has a nicer house. We are animals, after all. On a group level, this causes great benefits. On an individual level, it can cause unhappiness.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Most of the really happy people I know have a relatively small surface area. I know billionaires with two houses. Most of my close friends only have 4-5 close friends - everyone else is a friend in the loose sense of the word. Most of the productive people I know at work are focused on one or two things, not 5.</p> 
<p>The way to maximize your enjoyment in life is to keep your surface area small. It's a lot of work but if the happiest people I know are any indication, it's a lot less work to keep it small than to maintain it when it's large.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2024/01/15/surely-and-please.html" class="microblog_permalink">Jan 15, 2024 ↓</a> 
<p>Surely, and please give me grace if this isn’t the case, surely the people really upset about not being able to buy new Chinese manufactured cheap plastic crap adorned with the Australian flag surely have some old Chinese manufactured cheap plastic crap adorned with the Australian flag they could repurpose instead of vandalising and throwing flares into a Woolworths store operated by Australian humans who don’t have any Chinese manufactured cheap plastic crap adorned with the Australian flag?</p> </div> </div>
