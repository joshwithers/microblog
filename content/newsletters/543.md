<p>René Girard in <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/wanting-the-power-of-mimetic-desire-in-everyday-life/9781250262486">Wanting</a>:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>“Humans don’t desire anything independently. Human desire is mimetic – we imitate what other people want. This affects the way we choose partners, friends, careers, clothes, and vacation destinations. Mimetic desire is responsible for the formation of our very identities. It explains the enduring relevancy of Shakespeare’s plays, why Peter Thiel decided to be the first investor in Facebook, and why our world is growing more divided as it becomes more connected.”<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/02/15/ren-girard-in.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-02-15</a></p> </blockquote> <hr> 
<p><strong>Smiling for photos is largely the result of marketing campaigns</strong></p> 
<p>From this week's <a href="https://www.densediscovery.com/issues/175">Dense Discovery email</a>:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>When looking at older portraits (first painted, then photographed) you would notice that very few subjects smile. As this piece explains, up to the beginning of the 20th century, “a grin was only characteristic of peasants, drunkards, children, and halfwits”. In the first half of the 21st century, camera company Kodak tried to make the experience of having your photo taken less awkward and more fun, and thus created a marketing campaign to emphasise the pleasure of photography. The photographic smile became a byproduct of an increasingly sophisticated advertising culture focused on telling cheerful stories about products.</p> </blockquote>
