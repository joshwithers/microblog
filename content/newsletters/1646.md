<p><strong>What we measure is often not what matters</strong></p> 
<p><a href="https://www.thediff.co/p/is-everything-getting-old">Byrne Hobart, in The Diff</a>:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>"If actors are getting older and the music we listen to is getting older, it may be because TikTok stars, Twitch streamers, and Roblox creators aren't being counted among entertainers, even if they have a similar-sized audience. One thing that drags down the average age of Fortune 500 executives is when tech startups with young founders go public, but many of those startups don't have the revenue to qualify for the Fortune 500, even if their market cap puts them in the S&amp;P."</p> </blockquote> 
<p>This is the kicker, this is where the story is going. What we measure isn't always what matters:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>"Revenue is a lagging measure of impact, just as box office results are an output from fame."</p> </blockquote> 
<p>What else are we measuring that doesn't matter as much as something we're not measuring at all?<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/08/01/what-we-measure.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-08-01</a></p> <hr>

<p><strong>TikTok's talking points are totally cool, nothing to see here, move along now, everything's cool ya see</strong></p> 
<p>It almost seems like TikTok is the great globalist company we've all been waiting for, to save us from the boredom of our everyday lives, and to connect us - not with our friends - but with some kind of massive data store in China that I am totally sure is totally ok and nothing to stress about at all, ya know.</p> 
<p>TikTok's public relations talking points <a href="https://gizmodo.com/tiktok-master-messaging-pr-playbook-china-music-1849334736">via Gizmodo</a>:</p> <ul> <li>downplay the parent company ByteDance</li> <li>downplay the China association</li> <li>downplay AI</li> <li>TikTok is a global company</li> <li>The TikTok app doesn’t even operate in China</li> <li>TikTok is highly localised in its experience and operations, which means ... insert country here ... has a lot of independence in the day-to-day operations of the platform</li> </ul> 
<p>insert everything is fine gif</p>

<p>It was a good month for me on Unsplash. Zero dollars made, but millions of feel-good bucks.</p>

<p>“When you hit a wrong note, it’s the next note that makes it good or bad.”</p> </blockquote> 
<p>– Miles Davis<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/08/03/when-you-hit.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-08-03</a></p> <hr> 
<p>Many think that "the elites" or "the media" are pushing an agenda. They're not, it's actually worse. They're just giving us what we want so they can sell it to us and become wealthier.</p> 
<p>Heck, if I was them, I'd do it.</p> 
<p>Seth Stephens-Davidowitz in Everybody Lies:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>Many have viewed American journalism as controlled by rich people or corporations with the goal of influencing the masses, perhaps to push people toward their political views. Gentzkow and Shapiro’s paper suggests, however, that this is not the predominant motivation of owners. The owners of the American press, instead, are primarily giving the masses what they want so that owners can become even richer.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/08/04/many-think-that.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-08-03</a></p> </blockquote> <hr>

<p><strong>Write one blog post every day that scares you</strong></p> 
<p>If you're uncultured swine like me, you probably thought that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTJ7AzBIJoI">Baz Lurhmann gave this commencement speech and it was released as a song</a>.</p> 
<p><a href="https://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/mary-schmich-is-world-famous-but-you-may-not-know-her/">The truth is far more boring and interesting at the same time</a>.</p> <h2>Advice, like youth, probably just wasted on the young</h2> <blockquote> 
<p>Wear sunscreen.</p> 
<p>If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it. The long-term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists, whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience. I will dispense this advice now.</p> 
<p>Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth. Oh, never mind. You will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they've faded. But trust me, in 20 years, you'll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked. You are not as fat as you imagine.</p> 
<p>Don't worry about the future. Or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum. The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind, the kind that blindside you at 4 p.m. on some idle Tuesday.</p> 
<p>Do one thing every day that scares you.</p> 
<p>Sing.</p> 
<p>Don't be reckless with other people's hearts. Don't put up with people who are reckless with yours.</p> 
<p>Floss.</p> 
<p>Don't waste your time on jealousy. Sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind. The race is long and, in the end, it's only with yourself.</p> 
<p>Remember compliments you receive. Forget the insults. If you succeed in doing this, tell me how.</p> 
<p>Keep your old love letters. Throw away your old bank statements.</p> 
<p>Stretch.</p> 
<p>Don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your life. The most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives. Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don't.</p> 
<p>Get plenty of calcium. Be kind to your knees. You'll miss them when they're gone.</p> 
<p>Maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't. Maybe you'll have children, maybe you won't. Maybe you'll divorce at 40, maybe you'll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary. Whatever you do, don't congratulate yourself too much, or berate yourself either. Your choices are half chance. So are everybody else's.</p> 
<p>Enjoy your body. Use it every way you can. Don't be afraid of it or of what other people think of it. It's the greatest instrument you'll ever own.</p> 
<p>Dance, even if you have nowhere to do it but your living room.</p> 
<p>Read the directions, even if you don't follow them.</p> 
<p>Do not read beauty magazines. They will only make you feel ugly.</p> 
<p>Get to know your parents. You never know when they'll be gone for good. Be nice to your siblings. They're your best link to your past and the people most likely to stick with you in the future.</p> 
<p>Understand that friends come and go, but with a precious few you should hold on. Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle, because the older you get, the more you need the people who knew you when you were young.</p> 
<p>Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard. Live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft. Travel.</p> 
<p>Accept certain inalienable truths: Prices will rise. Politicians will philander. You, too, will get old. And when you do, you'll fantasize that when you were young, prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders.</p> 
<p>Respect your elders.</p> 
<p>Don't expect anyone else to support you. Maybe you have a trust fund. Maybe you'll have a wealthy spouse. But you never know when either one might run out.</p> 
<p>Don't mess too much with your hair or by the time you're 40 it will look 85.</p> 
<p>Be careful whose advice you buy, but be patient with those who supply it. Advice is a form of nostalgia. Dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it's worth.</p> 
<p>But trust me on the sunscreen.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/08/04/write-one-blog.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-08-03</a></p> </blockquote> <hr>

<p>I’ve been working on getting my Instagram account back to friends and family, after a decade of “better follow this account for brand and business reasons.” Turns out that unfollowing a thousand odd accounts over three days gets you locked out of Instagram for a week.</p>
