<p>What a wild ride.</p>

<p>“A typical Australian suburb spends about $4m on petrol and diesel per year. That creates half a job at the local petrol station which is mostly selling sugar and tobacco anyway – that’s like three things that can kill you in one store! Anyway, if everyone is driving electric vehicles and producing their own electricity, those $4m will stay in the community. We know from spending behaviour that 55% of that money will be spent locally, creating a huge number of jobs. Not just energy jobs, but it’ll be paying for better bakeries, new classrooms, a fresh coat of paint for the sports club, etc. I don’t think we ever really thought about just what a screamingly good thing that would be for every community.“<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/10/12/episode-five-of.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-10-12</a></p> </blockquote> <hr>

<p>I’m using the new Apple Translate app every day in Mexico, it’s pretty cool. Currently having a full conversation with my zero-English Uber driver, Jesus Angel (his name, not a prayer).</p> 
<p>My only addition would be the ability to reverse/swap languages easier.</p>

<p>I love <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1494942612">Morpho</a>, my new favourite currency (and other numbers) conversion iOS app.</p> 
<p>Ahead of travelling to Mexico I wanted to find a new currency conversion app that did two-three things:</p> <ol> <li>Had a Lock Screen widget to help me make purchasing decisions quickly and easily considering I still don’t really know how much 1,250 pesos is in personal terms.</li> <li>If they couldn’t do Lock Screen then at least do a widget.</li> <li>Once I opened the app, it gave me a few nuanced currency conversions. I wanted to be able to quickly get my head around AUD, MXN and USD numbers quickly.</li> </ol> 
<p>Morpho delivered plus they brought in other conversions like weights and temperature.</p> 
<p>The widget is great - you can choose which conversion to show, as you can see in the screenshot I wanted to always have a sense of what things on menus were worth so I settled on “what’s 100 pesos worth in Aussie dollars?”</p> 
<p>You can then tap the widget to open the app and whatever number you enter at the top is converted below.</p> 
<p>Travelling internationally with an iPhone soon? You’ll like this. Even Britt appreciates it and I can never get her on to new apps.</p>

<p><strong>Todos Santos</strong></p> 
<p>We left Los Cabos today for an adventure up to Todos Santos about an hour’s drive north of Cabo San Lucas.</p> 
<p>A few observations.</p> 
<p>1) The best branding I’ve seen for Mexican food yet is a restaurant called “Five Tacos and a Beer, Please.” You wouldn’t believe what the main item on the menu is.</p> 
<p>2) There are a lot of parties in Mexico, and a lot of beer and spirits are sold and consumed. I was the only person at the OXXO (think 7/11) who didn’t buy alcohol while I was there.</p> 
<p>3) it hot.</p>

<p><strong>One week in Mexico</strong></p> <ul> <li>There's a difference between good tacos and just tacos, good tacos are more likely to be in less-fancy buildings without flashy signage.</li> <li>Processing your Mexican temporary residency is much harder than they make it sound.</li> <li>Really should have learned more Spanish before getting on the plane.</li> <li>Even a nice Hilton hotel is still, in the end, just a hotel.</li> <li>It's amazing how terrible a car can be to still be listed for sale here. I looked at a car for 60,000 pesos (just under $5,000AUD) and I think someone was murdered in it but it wasn't cleaned.</li> <li>Horses, livestock, dogs and other animals all just roam free here. Must be tough for fencers to not be needed.</li> <li>Lawns don't exist here unless you're in a fancy place. It'd be hard to move here if your identity was built on how good your lawn is.</li> <li>Very few Australians are here or have visited here. Many people are surprised to hear we travelled so far.</li> <li>Should've stopped for a night or two in Los Angeles. 26 hours door to door was a lot for two toddlers.</li> <li>Always buy bottled water.</li> <li>Oysters taste different here. Bad different.</li> <li>I had to drive on the other side of the road for the first time in three years in the presence of a Mexican man whose car I was test driving. He must have spent the whole time wondering why a person who drove this bad wanted to buy a car.</li> <li>Money transfers internationally are never as quick as you'd imagine, especially over a weekend.</li> <li>There's little consistency between different offices of Mexican authorities. There's very much a local spirit in the decisions they make.</li> <li>We love it here.</li> <li>It's quite hot.</li> <li>Buy a good pram and travel cot, they're worth their weight in gold.</li> <li>Pack light, you don't need all that stuff.</li> <li>There are no Ubers, Didis, Lyfts or taxis in Todos Santos.</li> </ul>

<p><strong>Dear Kanye, get a blog</strong></p> 
<p>The most embarrassing thing about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/17/23408443/kanye-west-ye-parler-free-speech-social-media-platform?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">Kanye West buying Parler</a> isn't that he bought Parler, but that he (and most people) think that the world needs a new social media platform.</p> 
<p>It's the internet equivalent of starting or building more and more new gated communities in a town to make it safer and better.</p> 
<p>Ultimately the town without gated communities, but the ability to operate without the walls and gates is the better town.</p> 
<p>What does that mean on a modern worldwide computing platform like the internet? Get a blog. Use your keyboard, type some words, upload some photos, and share them with your mates. Get a blog roll. Share the love and seek out the things you love.</p> 
<p>The future of the internet isn't in the existing, or new, social networks or walled gardens. It's in freedom of expression and seeking your own inputs.</p> 
<p>At least then when Kanye does something stupid, I just get to choose to not read his blog. But if you want to, you can.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/10/17/dear-kanye-get.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-10-17</a></p> </div>
