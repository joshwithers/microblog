<p>Rick Rubin is the guest on <a href="https://tim.blog/2023/01/12/rick-rubin-2/">episode 649</a> of the Tim Ferris show and this is one of those podcasts you really want to listen to.</p> <blockquote> 
<p>"Look for what you notice that no-one else sees."</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Robert Henri's quote is quoted and man, this is sitting with me all day every day:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>"The object isn't to make art, it's to be in that wonderful state that makes art inevitable"</p> </blockquote> 
<p>This is a good listen.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/01/16/rick-rubin-is.html" class="microblog_permalink">2023-01-17</a></p> <hr>

<p>"A friend of mine told the story of driving along a country road one day with her little son, when he remarked: ‘Look at the beautiful tree, Mummy.’ She replied: ‘Yes, it’s a manna gum.’ There was a long silence from the back seat, broken at last by her child asking: ‘So is there a name for everything, then?’"<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/01/21/the-art-of.html" class="microblog_permalink">2023-01-21</a></p> </blockquote> <hr>
