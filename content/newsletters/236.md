<p><a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/interviews/james-cameron-confirms-that-the-most-badass-aliens-story-about-him-is-100-percent-true">James Cameron walks into the boardroom and</a> “wrote the word Alien on a board. Then he pluralized it, making it Aliens and insinuating he was about to up the ante on this planned sequel. Finally, he drew two lines through the S he had added, turning it onto a dollar sign.”<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2021/12/30/james-cameron-walks.html" class="microblog_permalink">2021-12-30</a></p> <hr>

<p>In 2016 Leonardo DiCaprio finally won an Academy Award. Many scholars believe this upset the gods and brought torment on our people and the only worthy sacrifice would be Betty White. May her sacrifice lead to peace in our land.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/01/01/in-leonardo-dicaptio.html" class="microblog_permalink">2021-12-31</a></p> <hr>

<p>Sliding doors.</p> 
<p>Daily Mail, 5 December 2000:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>"The internet may be only a passing fad for many users, according to a report."</p> </blockquote>

<p>I never thought I’d be in such a winning position, but if anyone is trying to buy a rat, the ones under my house are of good breeding and honestly I’m happy for you to take as many as you can hold.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/01/01/i-never-thought.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-01-01</a></p> <hr> 
<p>Joan Didion on being in the world:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>“I’m not telling you to make the world better, because I don’t think that progress is necessarily part of the package. I’m just telling you to live in it. Not just to endure it, not just to suffer it, not just to pass through it, but to live in it. To look at it. To try to get the picture. To live recklessly. To take chances. To make your own work and take pride in it. To seize the moment. And if you ask me why you should bother to do that, I could tell you that the grave’s a fine and private place, but none I think do there embrace. Nor do they sing there, or write, or argue, or see the tidal bore on the Amazon, or touch their children. And that’s what there is to do and get it while you can and good luck at it.”<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/01/01/joan-didion-on.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-01-01</a></p> </blockquote> <hr>
