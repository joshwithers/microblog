<p>I'm the guest on the most recent episode of Polka Dot Wedding's Feel Good Wedding Podcast. My audio recording isn't great because it was recorded in a small tiled Italian co-working office room, but the sentiment is great: getting married can be and should be awesome and enjoyable.</p> 
<p>Listen <a href="https://withe.rs/wKXc">on their website</a> or in <a href="https://podnews.net/podcast/iarve/listen">your podcast app of choice</a>.</p> 
<p>And thank you to Dorothy and Mary for having me :)</p>

<p>I'm a part of the Hobart wedding trail coming up in a few weeks. I'm expecting a great crowd to fly down and come and jump on a bus or boat and check out the Tasmanian wedding scene. My friend Nina at <a href="https://www.isleweddings.com.au/trail-2/">Isle Weddings</a> is hosting, check out her website for more info.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/09/01/can-anyone-i.html" class="microblog_permalink">Sep 1, 2023 ↓</a> 
<p>Can anyone I know remember the name of the modern web browser for MacOS System 9? I don't know why this matters to me so much but I need to browse the web inside a virtual machine of System 9 just to feel something today while I wait for news to occur for today's Sizzle.</p>

<p>Selling my beloved vintage Leica Z2X 35mm film camera for $700 AUD.</p>

<p>I bought it in Paris but I'd like to step up to a bigger film camera. The Leica has a 35-70mm zoom lens, autofocus is super quick and precise, so no more blurry pics, smart exposure control for a point-and-shoot film camera, shutter speed ranges from a slow 1/4 sec to a fast 1/300 sec. Plus, there's a "B" setting for long exposures. Serial number is 2378996 and it's got that infectious red dot.</p>

<p>Available for pickup on the Gold Coast (Palm Beach) or I can deliver to Brisbane, Sydney, Hobart, or weirdly Uluru over the next two weeks as those are places I'm going to be. Also driving from Sydney up to Gold Coast on Tuesday so I can deliver on the way.</p>

<p>Slip into my DMs if you're keen.</p> <h2>Examples</h2> 
<p>Here's some photos made with the camera around Paris this year. These images were scanned in Paris, I've straightened a few but the colours and exposure are out of camera.</p>
