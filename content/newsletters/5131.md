<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2023-07-mastodon-distributed-decentralised-fediverse-activitypub">The BBC has embraced ActivityPub</a>, nice work <a href="https://micro.blog/BBCRD@social.bbc">@BBCRD@social.bbc</a>! I've always thought that the long term advantage from a commercial and brand point of view is to be able to say "follow us" and the words that follow are your own brand and your own network.</p> 
<p>The power of Mastodon, ActivityPub, the Fediverse, means that the BBC can be on Mastodon, and someone else can be on a completely different platform that supports ActivityPub (like <a href="https://help.instagram.com/169559812696339">Threads</a> or <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> for example) and you can follow them. For example this very blog, because it's hosted on Micro.blog means you can follow @hello@joshwithers.blog on your favourite ActivityPub service, like Mastodon, Threads/Tumblr/Flickr one day soon, Pixelfed, or maybe even X if Leon gets his head right, and you can read the blog there. Even <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/">WordPress has an official ActivityPub plugin</a> now!</p> 
<p>In fact I could imagine that sometime in the future there'll be a new service that perhaps is more suited to a broadcaster like the BBC and they can transition from Mastodon to it, yet the social graph remains.</p> 
<p>When brands and companies operate their own Fediverse instances you can get the updates from your electricity company, you can follow your celebrity or known-person-that-is-a-cool-person and they all get to control their brand and their experience. Instead of mess like <a href="https://mastodon-uk.net/@BBCNewsUK">this</a> and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@bbc#.">this</a>.</p> 
<p>They are not at Twitter's, X's, Meta's, Google's or my mercy.</p> 
<p>They also are not at the whim of a verification service that is either a secret black box experience, or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/26/23808331/twitter-x-ads-advertising-incentives-verification-brands">thousands of dollars a month</a>.</p> <blockquote> 
<p>We're using social.bbc as the domain, so you can be sure these accounts are genuinely from the BBC.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>This is the social media future I'd like to see. Where following someone or something is as simple as sending and receiving email.</p> <blockquote> 
<p>As a large, high profile, public service organisation, we've had to work through a fair number of issues to get this far and we‚Äôve had advice and support from several teams across the BBC.
Explaining the federated model can be a challenge as people are much more familiar with the centralised model of ownership. We‚Äôve had to answer questions like ‚ÄúAre we running our own social network?‚Äù (well, we‚Äôre kind of hosting a small section of a social network) and ‚ÄúAre we hosting a user‚Äôs content?‚Äù (well, we don‚Äôt allow users to create accounts or post from our server, but they can reply to our posts from their own servers, and then their posts will appear next to ours and then they might be stored on our server and it all gets quite complicated).</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Does ActivityPub and the Fediverse have issues? Yes. Should that stop us from moving forward and trying to figure it all out? No.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/08/01/for-an-interesting.html" class="microblog_permalink">Aug 1, 2023 ‚Üì</a>

<p>I was today years old when I learned that the word 'homographic' didn't mean what my brain assumed it meant.</p> <blockquote> 
<p><strong>homograph</strong> - <em>noun</em> each of two or more words spelled the same but not necessarily pronounced the same and having different meanings and origins.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Like the word bass means a fish, an instrument, and a sound range.</p>

<p>I love my email. Not because I love my email but because due to the swings and round-a-bouts of modern life needing email, and because writers and publications I want to hear from send emails, I've figured out how to have an email account that I love. Which according to my friend Steven, isn't possible. Perhaps it is not dissimilar to training a demon to do the housework.</p> 
<p>But one day, I can only hope I am so unimportant, so unneeded, so unplugged from the swings and the round-a-bouts, that I can profess what <a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/%7Eknuth/email.html">Don Knuth wrote in the nineties</a>:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>I have been a happy man ever since January 1, 1990, when I no longer had an email address.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>His very-90s blog post is seemingly popular for advocating that the hyphen be dropped from e-mail, but I am so inspired to reach the stage of life that Knuth quotes in the post:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>`I don't even have an e-mail address. I have reached an age where my main purpose is not to receive messages.' ‚Äì Umberto Eco, quoted in the New Yorker</p> </blockquote> 
<p>A former boss told me that as you become more important in a job you start getting more keys, and you seemingly start on a path to have so many keys. Keys to the front door, back door, your office, someone else's office, the stationary cupboard, the storage room, etc etc.</p> 
<p>But then you reach a stage in that job where you are so important that you start handing keys back, and all of a sudden you have no keys.</p> 
<p>Being that important sounds lovely, but I'm more excited about being in such a position that my importance in the world is not an ongoing concern. Instead, my friendship, my love, my efforts would be so valuable to my friends and family that none of us would be measuring importance - or likes, views, follows, or subscriptions - but that we would be in that beautiful utopia of just being a friend.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/08/02/jake-meador-in.html" class="microblog_permalink">Aug 3, 2023 ‚Üì</a>

<p>Things I learned today:</p> 
<p>1) When you drive many kilometres past beautiful sunflower fields in Tuscany full of big and ripe sunflowers ready to be in a florist's shop window, five days later when you go back to photograph them they'll be harvested and in shop windows.</p> 
<p>2) Sunflowers follow the sun, so when you go out to shoot them at sunrise, they're all looking down like they've been listening to Nothing Compares 2 U on repeat since they found out about Sinead.</p> 
<p>3) "Sunflowers at sunrise in fog" isn't the epic photo I hoped for.</p>

<p>The PR-wing of the commercial radio community in Australia is getting everyone excited about a new <a href="https://www.commercialradio.com.au/RA/media/General/Documents/CRA-Deloitte-Connecting-Communities-2023-Report.pdf?ext=.pdf">report</a> - that they commissioned and is weirdly in their favour - about how commercial radio in Australia is turning 100 years old this year on November 23rd.</p> 
<p>The report tells a compelling story, which I don't consider to be the actuality of local and regional commercial radio in Australia.</p> 
<p><img src="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2023/cleanshot-2023-08-06-at-15.14.412x.jpg" width="600" height="408" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p> 
<p>A few takeaways from the report include:</p> <ul> <li>About three hours of locally significant content per day is broadcast in regional communities - which is pretty much just obeying the law.</li> <li>74% of Australians surveyed answered "sure, why not" when asked if they think commercial radio and audio build a sense of community.</li> <li>Over 1/3 of the jobs in commercial radio are in about 1/3 of Australian society (that being, regional Australia).</li> </ul> 
<p>And it was on the jobs issue I wanted to rebut the argument that Australian radio is "booming".</p> 
<p>It might be easy to try and point out that anyone born in the last 40 years doesn't know what the antenna on their car is for, or how the Australian commercial radio industry has very poorly stepped foot into podcasting and internet distribution, especially in regards to local and regional content, one of the biggest voids in the sphere of content available today.</p> 
<p>But instead I'll share a personal story that might tell you how booming commercial radio is in regional Australia.</p> <hr> 
<p>Late 2009 I accepted a role that I was so unqualified for that it was a joke. Twenty-seven years old, with only volunteer broadcast radio experience on my resume, having only even stepped foot in Western Australia once before at the other end of the state in Broome, let alone the small town of Esperance found on the far western side of the Great Australian Bight on Australia's southern coast, 720 kilometres from the most remote city in the world, a forty hour nonstop drive from home.</p> 
<p><img src="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2023/tateys-bait-and-tackle-ob-3975856393-o.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p> 
<p>The population of over 13,000 people had just shrunk a wee bit after the shock closure of the Ravensthorpe nickel mine in January of that year, but on a freezing cold Saturday morning this young buck who could not name song by The Travelling Wilburys found himself on the corner of Andrew and Demspter Street sitting at an outside broadcast studio in sub-zero temperatures (possibly).</p> 
<p>I fell in love with the town of Esperance and its small population. It was a crime that I didn't know who the Wilburys were considering one of its members had <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/local/photos/2012/10/31/3622669.htm">holidayed</a> there, and it was a shame that 14 years on I appreciate the then Radiowest, now Triple M, playlist a lot more than that 27 year old did.</p> 
<p>I moved on from that station to Star FM Port Macquarie just over a year later with many great friendships and a much more robust understanding of how to be a leading voice of a local community.</p> 
<p>I bring up this anecdote because through COVID things were rough in the wedding industry and Britt and I considered changing many things in our life. One possibility was moving somewhere regional and quiet, somewhere far away, somewhere like Esperance and when the job advert for my old job as breakfast radio host popped up I got in touch. I loved the town and would have cherished the seachange, now with two daughters and now married to the girl I wrote letters to the last time I lived there.</p> 
<p>Thirteen years on, with the Esperance population slowly growing, with industry slowly building, and the possibility for remote work in Australia slowly increasing thanks to the NBN and Starlink I thought things might be a little brighter for a modern family moving to the Great Southeast of WA.</p> <ul> <li>The cost of goods has increased 36% since I last worked in Esperance. If you paid $60,000 for something in 2009 you were paying $86,000 for it now.</li> <li>The average wage locally in Esperance (according to the ABS - <a href="https://abs.gov.au/census/find-census-data/quickstats/2021/LGA53290">2021</a> to <a href="https://abs.gov.au/census/find-census-data/quickstats/2006/LGA53290">2006</a>) has increased 65% over (about) the same time period.</li> <li>The cost of renting has actually doubled.</li> <li>Esperance-Goldfields property purchase prices have increased about 13%.</li> </ul> 
<p>But the wage on offer for the same job had decreased 7% and was most likely in a smaller team even though it was only a local staff of seven for two radio stations (I was the sole local programming hire) when I was there in 2009. There was the possibility of increasing the wage by also doing radio advertising sales but I've proven in the past that an advertising salesperson I am not.</p> 
<p>The same role, for a slightly larger audience which would be begging for local stories and content in an ever-globalised content world, was paying $938 a week after tax - $177 more than the minimum wage.</p> <hr> 
<p>The premise I'm making here is that the very heartbeat of commercial radio is creating a compelling story for an audience and inserting as many ads around that as possible. The fact that a community so bereft of local stories, news, and media personalities cannot support a good wage for someone to fill that role speaks to the weaknesses in the local media market, and the unwillingness of the corporation operating the media to invest there.</p> 
<p>I remember a time at Radiowest Esperance where the technology that connects the telephone line to the broadcast console - which was already the simplest of radio technologies, old and very very simple - broke down and there was real deliberation as to whether it should be replaced. I posited the question: are we planning on taking phone calls and broadcasting phone calls and interviews on the radio station in the future? Were phone calls being broadcasted important to the job? I believed they were, but at all levels of management they weren't sure it was worth it.</p>

<p>Maybe Esperance was never going to be a profitable radio station, and if so, hand the broadcast license over to a community radio organisation and let the community run it, like they do the fire and ambulance services.</p>

<p>Talking about the Esperance community spirit, we raised thousands (I think it was about $20,000) for the Perth Children's Hospital when businesses could push their boss off the Tanker Jetty into the subzero Southern Ocean winter waters if they raised or donated $1000. If any community was going to excel at a community radio station it would be Esperance.</p> <hr> 
<p>If a national commercial radio network can't afford to pay a local content creator more than $177 a week over the minimum Australian wage to create and broadcast about 24 hours a week of local content by themselves without local assistance, then I cannot believe that commercial radio is <a href="https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/media/commercial-radio-stations-are-soaring-in-popularity-new-report-shows/news-story/7290c37796eb3a78778073aed15a8bd8">soaring in popularity</a>, or even breaking even financially as a business. Instead, commercial radio in Australia sounds like an industry that has ignored advances in civilisation, in communication, in broadcasting, and how societies work in 2023 and is just hanging on by the threads of people who haven't got CarPlay yet.</p> <hr> 
<p>Rest in peace, commercial radio. You were my first love, but at one hundred years old maybe it's time to pass the batten to someone who understands how to be an integral part of a community.</p> <hr>
