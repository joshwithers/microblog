<p>Along with a social media age limit I'd like to see the app icons and splash screens changed to shocking images of people depressed, public servants dancing, or phone notification screenshots overflowing with replies featuring the opinions of strangers.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2024/09/11/all-the-news.html" class="microblog_permalink">Sep 11, 2024 ↓</a> <h3>All the News Fit to Print Is Not All the News</h3> 
<p>For the past week, a globally well-known person has been on the Gold Coast for a reason unrelated to their popular life as one of the world's foremost YouTubers and technology reviewers. Instead, they were here to represent the USA in the World Ultimate Championships, with their mixed team eventually walking away with gold medals in the finals.</p> 
<p>But you’d never know Marques Brownlee was competing on the Gold Coast unless you followed MKBHD, because the closest the Ultimate Championships got to any kind of media coverage was in Newcastle, where a local Ultimate player had been chosen to compete. A global championship of a future Olympic sport – allegedly under consideration for Brisbane 2032 and LA 2028 – and the only way you'd know about it is if you happened to walk past the Runaway Bay sports fields.</p> <hr> 
<p>The simple fact of the matter is that "the media" is not compelled or required to report on or tell the story of every little thing that happens in our community, even if it’s supported and sponsored by local and state governments or the national carrier.</p> <hr> 
<p>I’m reminded of when a law that I had a hand in creating passed. I expected there to be a news article about it that I could share with colleagues.</p> 
<p>But either no reporter was in parliament at the time, or if they were, they deemed this change to how Australia operated not fit for print.</p> <hr> 
<p>There’s something interesting about the news that you might not have noticed yet: every night, the news bulletin is the same length. The newspaper is a similar number of pages each day. And more so with printed newspapers, where there need to be ads sold by the sales team before there are pages waiting for stories.</p> <hr> 
<p>People often complain that their organic reach on social media is lower than it used to be. Despite the conspiracies surrounding Instagram and reach, the main contributor to the drop in numbers is the increase in creators and content, while the number of hours in our day has stayed the same.</p> <hr> 
<p>There’s a lot of quality life happening outside of newspapers, magazines, blogs, algorithms, interest graphs, TV, or radio.</p> 
<p>There are many great restaurants not on any list, and so many good cafes that don’t appear on Google when you search "best café near me." Billions of valuable, valid, and important stories never get shared by the news.</p> 
<p>A lot of life happens in the margins, and that’s where I’m trying to cast my eyes—towards the unseen and the unheard. Not only because there’s good there, but because the systems we live in, the societal scaffolding we’ve built, won’t go there.</p> 
<p>I have friends in Gold Coast media whom I could have called to tell about MKBHD and the championships, but that story wouldn’t have reached the top of the editorial pile. Not enough interest, not enough clicks, not enough views to report on a story like that. He’s just a tech reviewer. It’s just frisbee.</p> 
<p>The media isn’t evil or bad, but the laws of physics and capitalism means it can’t tell every story. That’s our job – yours and mine.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2024/09/11/i-would-personally.html" class="microblog_permalink">Sep 11, 2024 ↓</a>

<p>Wild how we use the same bowl for popcorn and vomit</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2024/09/12/well-that-was.html" class="microblog_permalink">Sep 12, 2024 ↓</a> <h3>Well, that was Swell</h3> 
<p>I made the 4am alarm to catch the 2024 Swell Sculpture Festival before sunrise this morning and as always it was a treat.
Something that stood out to me, and I don't know if it was new this year, but much of the art was priced. Some of the sculptures were on the way to $100,000!
If you can create art and put a price on it, and earn that price, then you're doing a thousand times better than I who simply places his art on Unsplash and Pexels in lieu of doing the hard work of making art that people want, putting a price on it that represents value and effort, and putting it to market.
More power to the artists who can exchange their art for good money, society will be better off for it.
These are the pieces that captured me, one in particular was interesting, the "Personal Space Elevator".</p>

<p>One of the redeeming features of our home when we bought it was that there was a great space for a veggie garden and some animals.</p> 
<p>So we got some help to clear the old veggie patches and to flatten it out ready for spring.</p>

<p>But while we were away in Queensland some big winds came through Tasmania, and although our area was one of the least affected, that wind tore three of our favourite wattle trees down.</p>

<p>Apparently wattle trees have about a twenty year expiry date and these three were ready.</p> <a href="{%20.Permalink%20}">Video</a> </div> </div>
