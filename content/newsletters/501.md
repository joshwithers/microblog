<p>Sitting next to a couple on a first date (over lunch at a kebab shop) and the poor girl is really trying to make this work. After about 30 seconds of silence she asks ‚Äúso do you read books?‚Äù</p> 
<p>He‚Äôs hesitant with an answer.</p>

<p>The Final Comeback of Axl Rose, by John Jeremiah Sullivan in 2006, referenced in the Rubesletter by Matt Ruby, today:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>Axl has said, "I sing in five or six different voices that are all part of me. It's not contrived." I agree. One of them is an unexpectedly competent baritone. The most important of the voices, though, is Devil Woman. Devil Woman comes from a deeper part of Axl than do any of the other voices. Often she will not enter until nearer the end of a song. In fact, the dramatic conflict between Devil Woman and her sweet, melodic yang‚Äîthe Axl who sings such lines as Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place and If you want to love me, then darling, don't refrain and Sometimes I get so tense‚Äîis precisely what resulted in Guns N' Roses' greatest songs‚Ä¶</p> 
<p>And what does she say, this Devil Woman? What does she always say, for that matter? Have you ever thought about it? I hadn't. "Sweet Child," "Paradise City," "November Rain," "Patience," they all come down to codas‚ÄîAxl was a poet of the dark, unresolved coda‚Äîand to what do these codas themselves come down? Everybody needs somebody. Don't you think that you need someone? I need you. Oh, I need you. Where do we go? Where do we go now? Where do we go? I wanna go. Oh, won't you please take me home?<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/02/09/the-final-comeback.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-02-09</a></p> </blockquote> <hr>

<p>How much are they paying for this myGov thing again? I got the notification email overnight, I've been anxious about it all day, finally got the guts to log in and find out what was wrong, and I owe them $0. Can I sue the ATO &amp; myGov for anxiety inducement?</p>

<p>"As I sat with him, I thought back to the conversation Zuckerberg and Durov allegedly had more than a decade ago. Both saw their nascent social networks as transcendent structures that would free communications from control by the state: governments and regulators reduced to the level of nuisances, rendered obsolete before the liberating force of a platform. Thinking this under a waning winter sun as my conversation with Telegram's VP concluded, I felt a chill."<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/02/09/how-telegram-became.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-02-09</a></p> </blockquote> <hr> 
<p>C. S. Lewis in a letter to a young fan:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>Don‚Äôt use adjectives which merely tell us how you want us to feel about the thing you are describing. I mean, instead of telling us a thing was ‚Äúterrible,‚Äù describe it so that we‚Äôll be terrified. Don‚Äôt say it was ‚Äúdelightful‚Äù; make us say ‚Äúdelightful‚Äù when we‚Äôve read the description. You see, all those words (horrifying, wonderful, hideous, exquisite) are only like saying to your readers, ‚ÄúPlease will you do my job for me.‚Äù</p> </blockquote>

<p><strong>Advice to a friend travelling Europe with a baby</strong></p> 
<p><em>A text message I thought was worth sharing as a blog post:</em> </p> 
<p>First stop, I reckon you need to get into a camera. Look at a Fuji X100 or a Sony RX100 as a start.</p> 
<p>Secondly, have you figured out your travel kit? For a trip like this, with a kid, I‚Äôd urge you to not take a laptop, maybe an iPad, and to work out a charging solution like an Anker multi-port
USB/USB-C charger with an international plug on it.</p> 
<p>Thirdly, have you chosen a travel cot and travel pram? The BabyZen YoYo travel pram is a cool glass of water in hell. You‚Äôll give me a sainthood for making you buy one. Choosing a travel cot is tricky, we have the Phil &amp; Ted‚Äôs which packs smaller, but the BabyBjorn and the new Bugaboo travel cots are still small but much quicker setup. Choose your poison.</p> 
<p><img src="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2022/7c77a27552.jpg" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p> 
<p>Basically, there‚Äôll be lots of dragging this stuff around, particularly in Venice where you have to carry everything, so take as little as possible.</p> 
<p>Have you phoned Qantas to request a bassinet seat?</p> 
<p>Here‚Äôs my city tips:</p> <ul> <li>
<p><strong>London</strong>: get into the palace and take out Prince Andrew.</p></li> <li>
<p><strong>Oxford</strong>: get an education.</p></li> <li>
<p><strong>Paris</strong>: have as many Nutella crepes as you can physically stomach and do the Big Red Bus tours, buy your wife nice things in the nice shops so that when you‚Äôre home and you have forty kids you can look at that nice sweater and remember that time you travelled the world.</p></li> <li>
<p><strong>Berlin</strong>: do a walking tour or two, the real Berlin is seen from street level, learn about the pedestrian crossing lights, look for bullet holes in the side of buildings, be surprised at the location where Hitler died, walk into every cool shop just because it‚Äôs cool, visit Computerspiele Museum - the computer game museum - it‚Äôs a lot of fun, stand in awe at the monuments, memorials, and existing parts of the wall. It‚Äôll move you.</p></li> <li>
<p>Unless of course you mean Bern in Switzerland in which case I have no idea. Same for Lauterbrunnen. I did not know these places existed until I googled them wondering if you didn‚Äôt mean Berlin.</p></li> <li>
<p><strong>Venice</strong>, I hear it‚Äôs lovely, but get up to Santa Monica while you‚Äôre there. Seriously though, I don‚Äôt know. Apparently you need to walk everywhere in the Italian version so pack light.</p></li> <li>
<p><strong>Florence</strong>: Get out into the regions, like San Gimignano, Siena, or Chianti or so many others, just get in a car and go. Italy‚Äôs regional areas are the opposite of Australia‚Äôs regional areas, which is to say, they‚Äôre really good. The main surprise is that they eat late and they don‚Äôt understand the concept of takeaway food, which is great if you‚Äôve got a crying baby. That said, feel free to pass her off to a nonna for a hug, this also applies to bub.</p></li> <li>
<p><strong>Rome</strong>: There‚Äôs a small handful of landmarks you‚Äôll probably recognise when you Google the town name, but my tip is to never eat in a palazzo. They‚Äôre full of tourists and bad food. There‚Äôs so many great restaurants there, but you have go to Trattoria Der Pallaro purely for the experience. Visit the Via del Corso Apple Store because its beautiful.</p></li> </ul>
