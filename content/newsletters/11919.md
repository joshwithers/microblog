<p>Seeing the Rode Wireless Micro release today (another spectacular release from Rode) reminded me how Australian companies and people are driving the infrastructure level of the creator economy.</p> 
<p>Rode Microphones, Blackmagic Design (cameras, accessories, switchers and DaVinci), Procreate, Envato, Canva, Linktree, and Fastmail are the big ones I can think about plus Pocketcasts, Whooshkaa, and Omny Studio in the podcast world. Also, Emojipedia!</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2024/11/12/i-asked-chatgpt.html" class="microblog_permalink">Nov 12, 2024 ↓</a> 
<p>I asked ChatGPT “Based on what you know about me draw a picture of what you think my current life looks like”</p>

<p>John Gruber <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/13/atkinson-prayers">tells the story</a> of Bill Atkinson’s battle (that has not finished yet) with cancer:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>“In addition to being a genius programmer, he’s by all accounts a kind and generous person. Everyone was (and remains to this day) in awe of his skills, but they remember him best for being a friend.”</p> </blockquote> 
<p>As a human, a man, a husband, and a father, I often (let’s be honest, almost always) get tied up with the worry and fear about work and business, earning money, and making good financial decisions.</p> 
<p>Keeping a good professional reputation in the desperate hope and prayer that another couple would find me and book me for their wedding.</p> 
<p>Staying in the good graces of wedding venues, wedding planners, the different algorithms and industry blogs and publications.</p> 
<p>But I swear if I get to the end of my days and you, Britt, and my children can't remember me best for being a friend then it was all for nought.</p> 
<p>I'm sorry if I've missed the mark on our friendship, it's honestly all I really want from these few fragile moments we have together on this pale blue dot in the universe.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2024/11/16/lets-talk-about.html" class="microblog_permalink">Nov 16, 2024 ↓</a> 
<p>Let's talk about the disconnect between mainstream media, social media chatter, and reality in Perth's coffee scene.</p> 
<p>When Starbucks opened their first WA store recently, both mainstream and social media were full of people insisting Perth would reject it in favour of local cafes.</p> 
<p>Well, I just visited this morning... The reality? Over 100 people inside and a 40+ car drive-through queue. Before 9am on a Saturday.</p> 
<p>Just a reminder that media opinions and online discussions don't always reflect what's actually happening on the ground. That Starbucks is absolutely thriving.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2024/11/16/pretty-cool-to.html" class="microblog_permalink">Nov 16, 2024 ↓</a> 
<p>Pretty cool to see <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-large-body-of-water-with-land-around-it-IOXdIXTv_74">my work</a> at Balandra Beach in Mexico on <a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/story/best-places-to-go-in-north-america-and-the-caribbean-2025">Conde Nast's Traveler</a> today.</p> 
<p>One day I ought to figure out how to be a professional profitable photographer instead of being an Unsplash dude.</p>

<p>Laying wide awake, trying to sleep in a Perth hotel, so I thought crunching some annual stats might help me sleep.</p> 
<p>2024 has been a wild year of travel. Here’s my 2024 travel stats as of when I get home on December 2:</p> 
<p>For 53% of 2024 I have slept in a bed I do not call home. 172 nights away from home, 94 flights, 85 marriage ceremonies, 275 hours in the air, 47 visits to Hobart Airport, 37 rental cars, 27 hours lost to flight delays, 15 airports, seven countries, six airlines, six Australian states, three trains, two boats, one moped.</p> 
<p>Qantas Platinum, Virgin Gold, Hotels.com Gold, and Accor Gold, Mitre 10 Silver. No I’m not joking about Mitre 10.</p> 
<p>Ask me anything except about the moped.</p> </div> </div>
