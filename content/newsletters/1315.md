<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/bring-back-the-aim-away-message/">It's Time to Bring Back the Away Message</a>, Lauren Good in WIRED:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>I miss Away Messages. This nostalgia is layered in abstraction; I probably miss the newness of the internet of the 1990s, and I also miss just being … away. But this is about Away Messages themselves—the bits of code that constructed Maginot Lines around our availability. An Away Message was a text box full of possibilities, a mini-MySpace profile or a Facebook status update years before either existed. It was also a boundary: An Away Message not only popped up as a response after someone IM’d you, it was wholly visible to that person before they IM’d you.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/06/08/its-time-to.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-06-07</a></p> </blockquote> <hr> <blockquote>

<p><strong>"The world is a museum of passion projects"</strong></p> 
<p>Three collected thoughts on what the world, all this around us, is:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>"As you become an adult, you realise that things around you weren't just always there; people made them happen. But only recently have I started to internalise how much tenacity <em>everything</em> requires. That hotel, that park, that railway. The world is a museum of passion projects."</p> </blockquote> 
<p>– @collision</p> <blockquote> 
<p>"Everything requires maintenance to avoid decay, and this ongoing cost is commonly underestimated and unappreciated by the inexperienced, ambitious, or distracted. Hence the virtue of focus and humility."</p> </blockquote> 
<p>– @saylor</p> <blockquote> 
<p>"That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader, once you discover one simple fact, and that is that everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you'll never
be the same again."</p> </blockquote> 
<p>– Steve Jobs</p>

<p>This is the weakest take. (See screenshot)</p> 
<p>A groom's role in a wedding is in equal nature to the other person being married.</p> 
<p>A wedding is not a "bride's day" or a single person's day.</p> 
<p>A wedding is an event hosted by the couple - together, where they actually do get married, but more importantly, they broadcast to their closest friends and family that this is who they are. That people like us, we celebrate and commemorate important things like this. You're erecting a billboard in your community that tells everyone what your values are and what kind of life you are building for yourself and your family.</p> 
<p>In this Quora post David is saying that exact thing. When important things happen to him and his wife, he closes his mouth, and doesn't look regretful, so his wife can be happy for just a moment, before she returns to her boring life where she has to put up with this downtrodden husk of a man.</p> 
<p>This is the actual real-life manifestation of toxic masculinity. </p>

<p>Posting this photo because I’m simply pretty proud of it. I’ve been carrying this 16mm lens around for a while in-case I was stuck between a rock and a hard place trying to get an interior shot. But yesterday I challenged myself to use it all afternoon.</p>
