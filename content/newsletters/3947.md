<p><strong>Six months a gringo and no bad days</strong></p> 
<p>Six months ago to the day we arrived in Baja California Sur without even knowing that’s what B.C.S. stood for in our hotel’s address as we filled out the entry cards.</p> 
<p>Six months on I have a wealth of stories that I feel odd about sharing. Most of them are about how different it is in Mexico compared to Australia. Who knew?! But I can’t find a way to tell the stories without admitting that they were witnessed through my own lens of how the world should be. Paved roads, hot and strong coffee, tacos with proteins other than seafood in them, and the story about the story about George Clooney the bartender told me, all really don’t matter, unless we’re a few whiskies deep around a campfire. It’s different here, not all roads are paved, and gringoes like me have been walking in for years wondering why things here aren’t like home.</p> 
<p>The truth is that Mexico is jam-packed with amazing people. We’ve never felt safer and we love it here.</p> 
<p>My one takeaway today is that in six months I’ve seen about six clouds. Baja really lived up to its slogan: no bad days.</p>

<p>Because I’m a man-child I wanted to share my two of my favourite photos from photographing the horse sanctuary in Baja</p>

<p>Will, a mate of mine has written and released a guide on working in film and television production, something he's an expert in.</p> 
<p><img src="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2023/b401974da3.jpg" width="100%”" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p> 
<p>I thought readers of my blog might appreciate <a href="https://www.wchandler.co">the book</a> if they or people they knew aspired to work in film production (it's a great and personal read, even for me, an old man without film and TV aspirations), but also, they'd enjoy this excerpt about what technology you should own and be proficient in before you start as a production assistant.</p> <blockquote> 
<p>“Seriously, people will look at you like you have three heads as you drag that eighty-pound hunk of plastic with the extended numerical keyboard from your bag and plop it on the desk.”</p> </blockquote>

<p>If you, or someone you know, wants a start in the film and TV production industry Will's <a href="https://www.wchandler.co">the book</a> is a must-purchase and must-read - and it's now on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C1TPXCJN">Kindle</a>.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/04/13/the-production-industry.html" class="microblog_permalink">2023-04-13</a></p> <hr> 
<p><strong>The news is incentivised to be broken and terrible</strong></p> 
<p>I was a media and news man for over a decade, I loved being - what I considered to be - an important part of the community, telling its stories and keeping the community informed, safe, and entertained.</p> 
<p>But the industry isn't doing well.</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://www.news.com.au/finance/money/costs/absolutely-insane-young-couples-shocking-story-of-being-nearly-15-million-in-debt-goes-viral/news-story/8631ce792b5102f70e6f8581837d963c">second story on news.com.au</a> today is about a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/young-couples-shocking-story-being-nearly-1-million-debt-goes-viral-absolutely-insane">Fox News story</a> about a recent TikTok that went viral, which the newsdesk found out about through a Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/sportynory/status/1645918001651421184">sharing the TikTok</a> in three parts, and the TikTok was just a replay of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMk7CKwJ8OM">Youtube clip</a> from a radio show four years ago.</p> 
<p>Serendipitously the original clip and radio show was broadcast about one kilometre from where I type this in Franklin, Tennessee, but there's no good reason for Australia's national news website - news.com.au - to publish this as a second story today. That the second most important story in Australia today is a four year old viral video is an insult to the wealth of stories Australia has to tell, and the global stories it could engage with.</p> 
<p>Yes, it gets the clicks. Yes, it's actually an important story inside the video, be debt free. But from a professional storytelling point of view it's embarrassing for the news.com.au staff. Even the actual article is poorly written and just lazy.</p> 
<p>This is the downfall of society, our storytellers are poorly incentivised to do good work, and over incentivised to do work that gets clicks that advertisers want even though no-one is clicking the ads.</p>

<p>Goldie, who just turned two, just buckled up her own airplane seat and is patiently awaiting takeoff whilst playing peek-a-boo with three different strangers and babbling to her neighbour.</p> 
<p>So yeah, I think she’s doing ok developmentally.</p>
