<p>I can't believe that so much valuable conversation is {you should give me all your money} interspersed with ads and unrelated content {gamble your money away!} these days as if it's a natural way to read and write {you're so stupid and fat} lol.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/11/07/i-cant-believe.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-11-08</a></p> <hr>

<p>Martha Gellhorn in a letter to Victoria Glendinning on 30th September 1987:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>"Anyway, I intend to spend the rest of my life wasting time."<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/11/08/martha-gellhorn-in.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-11-08</a></p> </blockquote> <hr> 
<p><strong>We don't have a Trump/Musk/political problem, we have a being human problem</strong></p> 
<p>I am continually fascinated whilst reading Letters of Note as to how people not of this time, people who lived 50, 100, or 200 years ago talk about the hardships and tribulations of modern life - in their own context - being hard and negative.</p> 
<p>Martha Gellhorn in a letter to Raleigh Trevelyan on boxing day 1967 wrote "Do you think it’s at all sensible to wish anyone a Happy New Year? I think the best one can do nowadays is just to wish that we all survive, year by year."</p> 
<p>Or as the preacher spoke to their church a few hundred years before Christ, recorded in the book of Ecclesiastes, "Meaningless! Meaningless! Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless!" and they continued, "I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind."</p> 
<p>All of humanity, forevermore, just trying to survive, year by year.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/11/08/we-dont-have.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-11-08</a></p> <hr> 
<p><strong>Apple Frames is the ultimate shortcut that most Apple computer users don't know about</strong></p> 
<p>Over seven years since Workflow first graced the Apple ecosystem - since then being acquired by Apple and renamed Shortcuts which makes it so easy to Google for information about - it's still a little-known tool on the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.</p> 
<p>My favourite shortcut - it's the ultimate shortcut - created by the ultimate Shortcuts guy, Federico Viticci at Macstories, is <a href="https://www.macstories.net/ios/apple-frames-3-0-completely-rewritten-support-for-iphone-14-pro-and-dynamic-island-new-devices-multiple-display-resolutions-and-more/">Apple Frames</a>. The shortcut has just been updated to its third version and is ever more powerful and works even better.</p> 
<p>You feed the shortcut one or more screenshots you've taken on the device, and it inserts the screenshot into an Apple device frame, so the resultant image carries more context. Examples beneath of some quick single screenshots, and three iPhone screenshots shared together in one image.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/11e1638ad1ec45abb01d99a12cb36f31">Get the shortcut here</a>.</p>

<p>We’re heading back to Hawaii in mid-January and it got me thinking about the last time I was there and I created a marriage ceremony across the bay from Aerosmith’s Steven Tyler house.</p> 
<p>I’ll never know if Steve witnessed me in my element on Maui, but they’ve never officially said what I Don't Want to Miss a Thing was about …</p> 
<p>Anyway, this is just your regular reminder that I make epic marriage ceremonies from Ipswich to Iceland and everywhere between.</p>

<p>It’s weird to see so much talk about Mastodon and people walk right past <a href="https://micro.blog">micro.blog</a>. I’ve been a user since <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a> launched it on Kickstarter, and I think I heard about it on <a href="https://micro.blog/gruber">@gruber</a>’s Talk Show - I love it.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/11/09/its-weird-to.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-11-09</a></p> <hr> 
<p><strong>Is swashbuckling still a thing?</strong></p> 
<p>Why don't we use the word "swashbuckling" more? It's a very cool word.</p> 
<p>The MacOS dictionary defines swashbuckling as an adjective as "engaging in daring and romantic adventures with bravado or flamboyance" and as a noun "daring and romantic adventure."</p> 
<p>It came to mind as I read Margaret Sullivan's book, Newsroom Confidential, and she recalled the story of Jeff Bezos addressing the Washington Post staff:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>“Even in the world of journalism, I think the Post is just a little more swashbuckling. There’s a little more swagger. There’s a tiny bit of bad-assness here at the Post.” After some applause and laughs from the exuberant crowd, Bezos elaborated on those words with some context: “Without quality journalism, swashbuckling would just be dumb. Swashbuckling without professionalism leads to those epic-fail YouTube videos. It’s the quality journalism at the heart of everything. And then when you add that swagger and that swashbuckling, that’s making this place very, very special.”</p> </blockquote> 
<p>My new life goal is to be described as swashbuckling.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/11/09/is-swashbuckling-still.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-11-09</a></p> <hr>

<p>A few thoughts on Mastodon at the end of day one:</p> 
<p>The network brand name is stupid and not sticky, as is “toot”.</p> 
<p>Running your own instance is not the best, but it’s not like there’s a perfect instance to join.</p> 
<p>Following people is too hard.</p> 
<p>It’s a nice system and I like it.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/11/12/a-few-thoughts.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-11-13</a></p> <hr>
