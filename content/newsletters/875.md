<p>Feels good to be back in Sydney/the Blue Mountains today. Feels like I’m back in the office like the good ol’ days.</p>

<p>Now that vaccinated segregation is coming to an end in Queensland why should we give up on classism now?</p> 
<p>I propose we start separating people based on race.</p> 
<p>Like, I don’t want to eat at the same cafe as a really fast runner, or F1 driver.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/04/05/now-that-vaccinated.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-04-05</a></p> <hr>

<p>It wet.</p> 
<p>Pilot just explained that he and the other pilot were flying up from Melbourne for this flight and baggage loading staff were low at Melbourne because people in baggage were off work with Covid so the delays just multiplied from there.</p> 
<p>2.5hrs late so far.</p>

<p>This week is one of those weeks where I’m reminded that I’m actually quite good at being a wedding celebrant and I really enjoy it despite a pandemic tearing out my soul. Just completed wedding 3 of 5 for the week and it’s only Wednesday.</p>

<p>The view from Kirribilli last night </p>

<p>I've got a hunch that this week will be the last one where Australia has a bloke named Scott Morrison as its Prime Minister. That election looms and the coalition wants someone else at the top.</p> 
<p>And that makes the team at 6 News' interview with ScoMo even more important. Consider it an exit interview.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/04/06/ive-got-a.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-04-06</a></p> <hr> <blockquote> 
<p>we're all looking for someting, not knowing exactly what it is.
then one day you’re driving toward the sunset with your window down, and wind running through your hair, as you think, “this is it, this is everything."
and all you had to do, is open the window and let it in.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li>jose chaves<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/04/06/were-all-looking.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-04-06</a> </li> </ul> <hr>

<p>Ned Kelly’s legacy in tatters.</p> 
<p>I booked a two night stay at this motel hoping for stay based on Ned Kelly’s principles of stealing livestock, denouncing the British Empire, and shooting Victorian police.</p> 
<p>Not comfortability and cleanliness.</p> 
<p>1 star.</p>

<p>Kim Beazely - former Deputy PM of Australia, Ambassador to the USA, and current Governor of WA - on the general operational capacity of the United States of America:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>“I think it’s brilliant the US actually works.”</p> </blockquote>

<p>One of my favourite aspects of the world wide web and the internet, is the process upon which we find people who think the same as we do. People whose minds vibrate on a similar frequency to ours.</p> 
<p>So I present to you: <a href="https://pswjt.substack.com/p/the-essence-of-place?s=r">Jameson Orvis's 'the essence of place'</a></p> <blockquote> 
<p>"The more I think about this label placement the more it pisses me off. Perhaps I could forgive the label for being so far from the geographic center of Brooklyn if the intersection of Brooklyn Ave and Atlantic Ave were at all remarkable. But no it’s just a random intersection along the A/C line with a 7/11 that the Google Maps label for Brooklyn just so happens to be positioned directly on top of.  Why not just put it in the actual center of the borough? What purpose does this serve? Who or what algorithm is responsible? I descended a rabbit hole."<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/04/11/one-of-my.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-04-10</a></p> </blockquote> </div>
