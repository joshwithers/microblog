<p>Steve Jobs:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>"When you're young, you look at TV and think "there's a conspiracy." The networks have conspired to dumb us down. But when you get a little older, you realise that's not true. The networks are in business to give people exactly what they want.</p> 
<p>That's a far more depressing thought."<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/09/01/steve-jobs-when.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-09-01</a></p> </blockquote> <hr> 
<p>Someone on Hacker News found an unbelievable Wikipedia article about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletics_at_the_1904_Summer_Olympics_%E2%80%93_men%27s_marathon">Athletics at the 1904 Summer Olympics – men's marathon</a></p> <blockquote> 
<p>"While Fred Lorz was greeted as the apparent winner, he was later disqualified as he had hitched a ride in a car for part of the race. The actual winner, Thomas Hicks, was near collapse and hallucinating by the end of the race, a side effect of being administered brandy, raw eggs, and strychnine by his trainers. The fourth-place finisher, Andarín Carvajal, took a nap during the race after eating spoiled apples."<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/09/01/someone-on-hacker.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-09-01</a></p> </blockquote> <hr> 
<p>Things people have said to me tonight as I DJ a wedding I wasn’t even supposed to DJ:</p> 
<p>Young female guest: Do you know who is playing right now? (Naughty By Nature <em>and I instantly age 20 years</em>)</p> 
<p>Young male guest: What Spotify playlist is this?!? (I chose songs individually because it’s just more fun that way)</p> 
<p>Middle aged female guest during a Missy Elliot song and just after September by Earth, Wind, and Fire have played: can you play more songs for us oldies, we don’t like this music and no-one’s dancing (I’m looking at a full dance floor).</p> 
<p>A tip if you’re attending a wedding, save your requests for your drive home.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/09/02/things-people-have.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-09-02</a></p> <hr>

<p>It’s empowering seeing Ampol throw around the word “restaurant” so liberally. I’m going to erect a sign out the front of my house that says “male model”.</p>

<p>Three year-old firstborn looks at me as I’m putting her to bed tonight and says “when you were a little boy I made you a daddy!”</p>
