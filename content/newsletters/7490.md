<p>Matt Ruby on metadata:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>"Is metadata really that powerful?"</p> 
<p>"OK, let's say there's a guy who texted a girl 5 times without getting a reply. Would you need to actually read the messages to know what's going on there?"</p> 
<p>"Nah, I 100% get what happened."</p> 
<p>"That’s the power of metadata."</p> </blockquote> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2024/02/21/the-ceo-of.html" class="microblog_permalink">Feb 21, 2024 ↓</a> 
<p>The CEO of the biggest supermarket chain in Australia is stepping down because no other news media dared question an advertiser.</p> 
<p>This is the strength and power of listener/reader supported media, and the strength of publicly funded media.</p> 
<p>You can't lose an advertiser because you asked good questions, because you aren't reliant on, or don't have, advertisers.</p> 
<p>Our reluctance to individually fund good journalism are part of the reason our groceries are so expensive, that and because we're too lazy to shop around, or better, buy local food from local producers.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2024/02/23/im-thoroughly-convinced.html" class="microblog_permalink">Feb 23, 2024 ↓</a> 
<p>I'm thoroughly convinced that email can be a meaningful method of communication, relationship, community, and entertainment in the future. I've always been proud of what my friend <a href="https://micro.blog/james@bne.social">@james@bne.social</a> is making at <a href="http://podnews.net">@podnews.net</a> so reading <a href="https://www.editorandpublisher.com/stories/newsletter-20-the-emergence-of-single-page-media,248246">this article</a> by Guy Tasaka encourages me in my little prophetic thought.</p> <blockquote> 
<p>I have a deep appreciation for newsletters. They say everything old is new again. Today, with an almost overwhelming amount of information we must sift through on news sites, social media and third-party aggregation sites, like Apple and Google News, it’s nice to have information curated and summarized for me and delivered to my inbox. That kind of sounds like a newspaper.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div>
