<p>A fancy hotel in Brisbane is trying to engage the Streisand effect by asking that these photos be removed from my Unsplash profile. It's funny that brands are still trying to discourage user-generated content in 2022.</p>

<p><a href="https://taylorlorenz.substack.com/p/you-dont-want-the-old-instagram">Taylor Lorenz on why you don't want the old Instagram back</a>:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>"It's tempting to think that if Instagram simply reverted to a previous design or reinstated a chronological feed, that would somehow bring us closer to the people we care about. But we don't forge personal connections by sharing or commenting on highly personal public-facing photos that are permanently displayed on a grid anymore. These days, intimacy is fostered through features like DMs, group chats, or ephemeral posts to Close Friends."<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/07/28/taylor-lorenz-on.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-07-28</a></p> </blockquote> <hr>

<p>*<em>Zuckerberg and the rice playpen *</em></p> 
<p>As I write this I’m standing in what used to be a seed, or maybe rice, playpen at a local indoor play centre.</p> 
<p>Used to be, because this last week they’ve removed the seed/rice and left the floor in this playpen bare like the other areas in the centre. Apparently the upkeep of that one playpen resulted in a whole extra staff member, so the seed pen just wasn’t good for business. They’re now saving a wage, and the business plan</p> 
<p>It was good for play, though. My three year old was very worried about its absence, and honestly, it was the main drawcard for this play centre. I’ve never seen it empty, and every toddler in the room desperately wanted to run their fingers through the hundreds of kilograms of other-kid-germ-infected seed. The seeded play pen was good for so many things, just apparently not for business.</p> 
<p>This, seemingly, is the art of business. What can I add to my vehicle driving toward our North Star that makes the product or service more valuable, more desirable, more wanted. What can I take away that would not detract from those same elements.</p> 
<p>How can we be driving towards our North Star with the least amount of baggage, and the most amount of joy and soul intact?</p> 
<p>I wonder if letting that staff member go and removing the rice increased joy, soul, satisfaction in the play centre? </p> 
<p>Which makes me think of this line from Mark Zuckerberg of Meta/Facebook/the metaverse this week:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>“Our north star is can we get a billion people into the metaverse doing hundreds of dollars a piece in digital commerce by the end of the decade? If we do that, we’ll build a business that is as big as our current ad business within this decade. I think that’s a really exciting thing. I think a big part of how you do that is by pushing the open metaverse forward, which is what we’re going to do.”</p> </blockquote> 
<p>What a soulless and boring North Star. Get back to me when your metaverse has a germ-ridden rice pen, Zuck.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/07/31/zuckerberg-and-the.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-07-30</a></p> <hr> 
<p><strong>Reels is less than half as successful as Stories was on the same theft timeline</strong></p> 
<p>Nathan Baschez in <a href="https://every.to/divinations/instagram-s-existential-bet">Every</a>:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>Is Reels even working?</p> 
<p>Yes and no. Reels is now two years old and, according to my reading of the data, it’s only working about half as well as Stories was two years after it launched.</p> 
<p>Back in 2018, when Stories was as old as Reels is now, Kevin Systrom was asked about the proportion of time spent in Stories. He declined to give a number but claimed it was “almost just as important” as the main feed. So I’m assuming it was probably somewhere in the 40–50% range.</p> 
<p>Reels, on the other hand, only accounts for 20% of time spent—despite the fact that Instagram is pushing it a lot harder. The only thing they did to get us to use Stories was put that little row of circles at the top of our feeds. But now they’re actually sprinkling Reels directly inside our feeds so they’re impossible to ignore. If it was just a little row you could quickly scroll past, I bet that 20% figure would be much lower, perhaps below 10%.</p> </blockquote>

<p><strong>The radio is dead, long love the radio</strong></p> 
<p>Tim Burrowes in <a href="https://www.unmade.media/p/what-we-learned-from-listnr-yesterday?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">Unmade</a>:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>The meat of the event came in the panel, which included SCA CEO Grant Blackley. As is regularly the case, he was refreshingly less guarded than most of his peers. He actually told us some of what he was thinking about the company’s future direction.</p> 
<p>It included acknowledgement that <strong>the day will come when the transmitters will be turned off</strong>, and all audio is delivered digitally. While an obvious observation, there was a time not so long ago when that would have been sacrilege coming from the person who is also chairman of Commercial Radio Australia.</p> 
<p>Slightly to the surprise (I think) of his colleagues, Blackley also confided that he is thinking about making Listnr the main company brand. “One day you might no longer see us called SCA. You might see us called Listnr. I could see a world where if it is in fact at the centre of our universe and it is driving all of our growth and ambitions, and it houses all of our product, maybe there’s a natural extension there… who knows?”</p> 
<p>He knows. Given that he told the audience he’d made the same point on stage at the Radiodays conference in Europe a few weeks back, I think the answer to that is that he’s already decided.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Although this is a very obvious path for the radio industry to take, because it’s where the eyes in the ears and the attention has moved.</p> 
<p>The one remaining issue is that as a technology, AM/FM radio, DAB digital radio, and digital television broadcast, are actually quite beautiful technologies. </p> 
<p>High definition delivery of audio and visual signals across an entire city and there’s no ISP charging per gigabyte. The only thing required to listen is a simple radio or TV receiver. As much as radio and TV as we know it today will die, it will never go away, I wonder what form it will take in the future?</p> 
<p>I wonder what will fill the FM channels in 20 years time?</p>

<p>I’ll always love the radio, it was a beautiful medium in 2009 when this photo of me was taken. Today, the same radio stations are playing the same tune in a different world. That season needs to end, but what does the next look like?<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/07/31/the-radio-is.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-07-31</a></p> <hr>
