<p>Maryanne Wolf <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/religion/maryanne-wolf-cultivating-deep-reading-in-a-digital-age/102001224">on reading</a>:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>Literacy literally changes the human brain. The process of learning to read changes our brain, but so does what we read, how we read and on what we read (print, e-reader, phone, laptop). This is especially important in our new reality, when many people are tethered to multiple screens at any given moment.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>She also quotes this which really makes me want to throw the TV in the bin:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>When watching a screen, the infant is bombarded with a stream of fast-paced movements, ongoing blinking lights and scene changes, which require ample cognitive resources to make sense of and process. The brain becomes ‚Äúoverwhelmed‚Äù and is unable to leave adequate resources for itself to mature in cognitive skills such as executive functions.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/03/20/maryanne-wolf-on.html" class="microblog_permalink">2023-03-20</a></p> </blockquote> <hr>

<p><strong>A new website for Los Sagrados Horse Sanctuary</strong></p> 
<p>Flexed my vintage graphic design skills for the local Baja horse sanctuary recently and I‚Äôm pretty proud of the work I‚Äôve done.</p> 
<p>I used to do web design professionally back in the olden days when computers were stone tablets and Jesus was a boy. </p> 
<p>Plus before now you couldn‚Äôt find the ranch on Apple or Google Maps properly, and all the search engines and AI chat models didn‚Äôt know about them.</p> 
<p>Over the coming weeks that will all change as the databases and algorithms catch up.</p> 
<p>The horse sanctuary is a registered Mexican charity so they can now take donations online, and they‚Äôre on the way to taking horse riding reservations online, selling tickets to events, and also operating as an event venue with online booking etc.</p> 
<p>Plus they‚Äôve now got email on their own domain name so they look and feel more professional to donors and grant-giving organisations.</p> 
<p>Finally, for the first time in a web design project I got to make all the photography with Britt so we had full creative control of the project.</p>

<p>Had coffee at a cafe in Todos Santos today where they hand out 30-minute wifi access codes. They mixed my order up - bringing a cold americano with hot milk when I ordered the reverse - so my 30 minutes ran out in the middle of a text chat.

<p><strong>Three years of hell</strong></p> 
<p>Three years ago today I had the wildest, wettest day at work so far. Bringing a wedding forward a day, performing the wedding ceremony I already had for that day, then doing the brought-forward ceremony in the rain, rushing back to Sydney Airport from the Blue Mountains, every store is closed in the airport and we catch the fabled last flight into Queensland before they closed the border.</p> 
<p>Three years of hell. Here‚Äôs to never getting so silly ever again. You can‚Äôt stop people from dying, it‚Äôs inevitable, but you can stop people from living.</p>

<p>First, you need some water. Fuse two hydrogen with one oxygen and repeat until you have enough. While the water is heating, raise some cattle. Pay a man with grim eyes to do the slaughtering, preferably while you are away. Roast the bones, then add to the water. Go away again. Come back once in awhile to skim. When the bones begin to float, lash together into booms and tow up the coast. Reduce. Keep reducing. When you think you have reduced enough, reduce some more. Raise some barley. When the broth coats the back of a spoon and light cannot escape it, you are nearly there. Pause to mop your brow as you harvest the barley. Search in vain for a cloud in the sky. Soak the barley overnight (you will need more water here), then add to the broth. When, out of the blue, you remember the first person you truly loved, the soup is ready.

<p>In 1675, A French merchant named Jacques Savary published The Perfect Merchant, a mercantile manual that came to double as a guide for doing commerce around the world. Albert O. Hirschman cites Savary to explain how capitalism, which would have been regarded as little but avarice as recently as the 16th century, became the sanest ambition of humans in the 17th.</p> 
<p>Savary strongly believed that international trade would be the antidote to war. Humans can‚Äôt conduct polyglot commerce across borders without cultivating an understanding of foreign laws, customs, and cultures. Savary also believed the Earth‚Äôs resources and the fellowship created by commerce were God-given. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not God‚Äôs will that all human necessities be found in the same place,‚Äù Savary wrote. ‚ÄúDivine Providence has dispersed its gifts so that humans will trade together and find that their mutual need to help each other establishes ties of friendship among them.‚Äù<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/03/25/virginia-heffernan-in.html" class="microblog_permalink">2023-03-25</a></p> </blockquote> <hr>

It‚Äôs taken me 80 years to figure out that it‚Äôs not a tranquil, sunlit realm at the top of the ladder you‚Äôve spent your whole life hauling yourself up, rung by rung.

<p><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/mental-health-liberal-girls">Jon Haidt in Why the Mental Health of Liberal Girls Sank First and Fastest</a>:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>There was a culture that was encouraged on Tumblr, which was to be able to describe your unique non-normative self. That‚Äôs to some extent a feature of modern society anyway. But it was taken to such an extreme that people began to describe this as the ‚Äúsnowflake‚Äù (referring to the idea that each snowflake is unique), the person who constructs a totally kind of boutique identity for themselves; then guards that identity in a very, very sensitive way; and reacts in an enraged way when anyone does not respect the uniqueness of their identity. On the other side of the political spectrum, there was the most insensitive culture imaginable: 4chan. The communities involved in gender activism on Tumblr were mostly young progressive women while 4Chan was mostly used by right-leaning young men, so there was an increasingly gendered nature to the online conflict. The two communities supercharged each other with their mutual hatred, as often happens in a culture war. The young identity activists on Tumblr embraced their new notions of identity, fragility and trauma all the more tightly, increasingly saying that words are a form of violence. Meanwhile, the young men on 4Chan moved in the opposite direction; they brandished a rough and rude masculinity in which status was gained by using words more insensitively than the next guy. It was out of this reciprocal dynamic that today‚Äôs Cancel Culture was born in the early 2010s. Then, in 2013, it escaped from Tumblr into the much larger Twitterverse. Once on Twitter, it went national and even global (at least within the English-speaking countries), producing the mess we all live with today.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/03/25/jon-haidt-in.html" class="microblog_permalink">2023-03-26</a></p> </blockquote> <hr>
