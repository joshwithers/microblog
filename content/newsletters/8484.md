<p>Kids, gather round for an Australian TV, culture, and music history lesson.</p> 
<p>On Instagram ABC TV's Rage account <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C6C8FqKPutV/">posted</a>:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>Anyone remember when <a href="https://micro.blog/abctv">@abctv</a> used to close down overnight? ‚Ä¶. Neither do we üòè Back before rage took control of the late night silver screen in 1987, this station closer was played out to signify the end of the day‚Äôs programming to the tune of Mike Oldfield‚Äôs track ‚ÄòWonderful Land‚Äô. Another beauty from the rage archives!"</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Which is missing an unimportant piece of fact which is linked to an only slightly more interesting story about Australian music.</p> 
<p>Back in the old old days ABC TV would close overnight and it would be a number of hours - dependent on day and programming etc - until Rage would start. For the uninitiated, Rage is like MTV in 1982 if it was public access, government-funded, basically no hosts unless there was a band guest-hosting for a few hours. It was just non-stop music videos.</p> 
<p>And for those of us (darn youth) who might have stayed up that late at night, 'waiting for Rage' became a thing ... if you were lazy or had no video tapes to watch or nothing else to do you'd leave the TV on waiting for Rage to begin in silence with nothing on the screen.</p> 
<p>This lead to the bad Seven 8ths Torn self-titled album final track called "Waiting for Rage!" which was something like 16 minutes of silence.</p> 
<p><img src="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2024/s-l1600-2.jpg" width="600" height="485" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p>

<p>And yes, I am contemplating spending $44 just to <a href="https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/293808446212">buy this album on eBay</a>, the listing from which I grabbed those images, it's potentially the last remaining copy.</p> 
<p>I say all that to say this, that Seven 8ths Torn left an impact on my youth, I saw them live at a local <a href="https://www.concertarchives.org/venues/canelands-sound-shell">sound shell</a> in a <a href="https://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/mackay/death-knell-for-park-soundshell/news-story/510b0d5f26760e1273eeb98ece21131a">park</a>, and it's kind of amazing that they exist in like two places on the Internet now and one of them is an eBay listing. There was a whole Triple J Unearthed series in the 90s and it doesn't exist online, like anywhere I can find. Triple J Unearthed held a live in-person music competition at the Canelands Sound Shell and according to what I can find online that event never occurred.</p> 
<p>Some of my favourite albums I still listen to today don't exist online.</p> 
<p>It's just kind of wild how much knowledge, culture, wisdom, art, truth, beauty exists outside the realms of Californian data centres.</p>

<p>I honestly didn't know that public speakers like comedians, Arj Barkers, and wedding celebrants were allowed to have opinions on babies being in the audience.</p> 
<p>I hereby request that all babies at weddings I'm officiating in the future would share their snacks with me, or they can leave.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2024/04/25/in-will-we.html" class="microblog_permalink">Apr 25, 2024 ‚Üì</a> <h3>In 2115 will we still commemorate Anzac Day like we do today?</h3> 
<p>Anzac Day 1916 was a very different ANZAC Day compared to that I experienced in Canberra this morning. Martin Crotty, a historian at the University of Queensland, said that Anzac Day commemorations have "suited political purposes right from 1916 when the first Anzac Day march was held in London and Australia, which were very much about trying to recruit more people to join the war during 1916-1918." </p> 
<p>As war efforts changed over the last 109 years, and eventually subsided, the Anzac Day commemorations have taken on a more solemn and meaningful practice. After attending the 2024 Dawn Service at the Australian War Memorial this morning--my first in Canberra, and possibly my fifth as an adult--I have some thoughts. </p> 
<p>I'm not going to discuss how I thought arriving half an hour early for a 5:30 am service would be "early enough" to secure a good viewpoint--it was not, and I'm pretty sure that most of the 30,000 attendees beat me to the Sculpture Garden this morning. Nor will I mention how the lacklustre audio and video production at the memorial left me feeling blind and deaf, yet my hearing was sharp enough at 5:30 am to hear someone vomiting behind me and a staff member using one of those hand-held clickers commonly used by bouncers, walking through the crowd in the dark, clicking away. </p> 
<p>I won't wax lyrical about how the male performers were named and the master of ceremonies asked the crowd to applaud them, yet the female performers were neither named nor acknowledged. </p> 
<p>Where my mind is at, here in the Canberra Qantas Lounge at 4pm on the twenty-fifth of April, is the book I'm currently seven percent through on my Kobo e-reader, "Van Diemen's Land" by James Boyce, and a PhD candidate from Turkey who was ahead of me in line for a bacon and egg roll after the service. </p> 
<p>The PhD candidate studying tourism in Turkey has come to Australia for a few weeks to complete his study on why Australians aren't visiting Gallipoli for Anzac Day anymore. Apparently, for the centenary in 2015, over 40,000 Australians and New Zealanders made the pilgrimage, but numbers have significantly dropped, to about 1,500 last year.</p> 
<p>I can't shake the feeling that Anzac Day needs to continue to evolve.</p> 
<p>In 2115, are we expecting our great-grandchildren to be trekking to Gallipoli, or even to the Australian War Memorial, to remember the events of April 1915?</p> 
<p>Or can the spirit of Anzac Day start to embody more of the Australian spirit, leading me to James Boyce's "Van Diemen's Land"?</p> 
<p>The thorough rewriting and retelling of Tasmania's history should be a must-read for all Australians--not for the interest in the Apple Isle--but for a thorough understanding of the relationship between the first Australians, the early whalers and sealers, the French, the Dutch, and the British.</p> 
<p>I was sold a narrative as a child that there was nothing here on Terra Australis except for some savages until the Brits arrived, and then some things happened, then we got Channel V. My little brother was born in 1988, so he got a cool birth certificate because the country was 200 years old, and I got a trip to Expo '88. Simpler times.</p> 
<p>Modern brave and valiant efforts to flesh out that story with truth, to include First Australians, their sovereignty, and their story, have undoubtedly helped me understand more about the brutality inflicted by the early settlers and the sudden change to the Aboriginal way of life-- one day they're living their hashtag bestlife, and the next, some guy is waving a metal rod of murder towards them, killing some of their friends and family.</p> 
<p>James Boyce's nuanced approach to the 18th and 19th-century tension has led me to a greater understanding of the times. An understanding that softens the often poisonous narrative about the early explorers and convicts, acknowledging that they were strangers in a new and foreign land, and also that the locals were being impacted by strangers in their homeland. </p> 
<p>One simple story that greatly impacted me was about how back-burning was misunderstood. We now know that Australian Aborigines are experts in land and bushfire management, and we also have evidence that being caught in a bushfire isn't exactly conducive to survival. In what would be one of the earliest misunderstandings between local Aboriginals and settlers, the Aboriginals were back-burning on their land, as was their right and responsibility, but the British were terrified and believed they were under attack from the Aboriginals.</p> 
<p>There are countless other stories from that time of the early explorers, soldiers, and convicts having extremely positive relationships with the First Australians.</p> 
<p>But the scarlet thread through it all are tensions between the nations and their people.</p> 
<p>The path of reconciliation made its way into the twentieth century where the First Nations people of Australia fought alongside the first immigrants of Australia in World War I, albeit paid dismally and treated worse, and still today our people struggle with that tension between our peoples, working feverishly to close that gap and heal the wounds.</p> 
<p>I was reminded of that as one of the speakers at the War Memorial dawn service this morning recounted the 1944 story of the Battle of Leyte Gulf in the Philippines, where HMAS Australia was attacked by the Japanese.</p> 
<p>In 2024, Japan is the number one nation Australians are visiting--willingly, for leisure and fun--only 80 years after we lost thirty Australians to a Japanese kamikaze aircraft attack.</p> 
<p>The story I see being told on Anzac Day 2115 is a story of principles being held and fought for, and tensions being identified and resolved, a story of reconciliation.</p> 
<p>Perhaps today we can start sharing that beautiful, rich, and rare story of resolved tension, principles of treaty between the First Australian nations and those of us who come across the seas for the boundless plains to share. May we advance Australia fair.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2024/04/27/one-day-when.html" class="microblog_permalink">Apr 27, 2024 ‚Üì</a>

<p>Wedding photography is about to evolve in two ways.</p> <ol> <li>After a century in the closet, Sepia is about to come into fashion</li> <li>The wedding content creator is only a temporary role in the industry, the wedding photography market will splinter, with some wedding photographers moving down market to push the content creators out, and some will move up market, and all will need to reconcile the fact that no-one is hoping their wedding photographs and films take weeks or months to colour grade and process.</li> </ol> <hr>
