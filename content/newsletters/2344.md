<p>I’m reflecting on the recent Optus hack today as I wonder what to do with my phone number I’ve had for 20 odd years.</p> 
<p>So much of modern society needs a phone number to work and to identify us.</p> 
<p>New services register with a phone number and text message verification code, trusting that only you would have your phone number or SIM card.</p> 
<p>When I turn off my Australian SIM card in Mexico iMessage warns me the clock has started.</p> 
<p>It’s kind of ridiculous that something as fragile as a phone number is the backbone of identity.</p> 
<p>I think do Dave Winer’s ten year old blog post proposing <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2012/02/23/thinkingOutLoudDnsAsId.html">DNS as a form of ID</a>, but I feel like that would exclude so many normies.</p> 
<p>Funnily enough, in many parts of Mexico the police will take your number plate or drivers license back to the police station as that’s the closest the national identity systems don’t really exist here.</p> 
<p>How are we supposed to verify who we are? Maybe a blue tick will help?</p>

<p>Business idea: a coffee translator.</p> 
<p>All I want in Mexico is to just order my coffee.</p> 
<p>In Australia I order a long black with cream (pouring cream), or if they don't have cream, with cold milk. I call it a poor man's latte. All of the coffee, less milk.</p> 
<p>A big cup of black coffee, and I take the temperature and black-coffee-ness out of it with a dash of dairy.</p> 
<p>In Baja an Americano is basically a long black, but often filter coffee which would be fine if it was lukewarm. An espresso is an espresso shot. A long black doesn't exist. I got close today, but once I asked for "like an Americano but hot", they also brought out hot milk, and you don't want hot milk in this drink.</p> 
<p>My fortune for help on how to order a "long black with cream/milk" in Spanish, or in a way that local baristas will understand.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/11/02/business-idea-a.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-11-02</a></p> <hr>

<p>Thinking about Berlin’s computer Game Museum, the <a href="https://www.computerspielemuseum.de">Computerspielemuseum</a>, today.</p> 
<p>It’s the only building in Berlin I can walk into and feel nostalgic and childlike.</p>

<p><strong>Wondering about Unsplash and why my recent work isn't resonating</strong></p> 
<p><a href="https://unsplash.com/@joshwithers">I've been uploading to Unsplash</a> for almost five years, and people always ask why I would submit my work to a website that gives it away mostly for free?</p> 
<p>I consider <a href="https://unsplash.com">Unsplash</a> my photography mentor and university. Because ultimately, I believe, that good work resonates with people. Firstly it has to resonate with you, but secondly with someone else. It doesn't have to be the most popular work in the history of work, but a successful artwork resonates with at least as many people as that created it, in my humble opinion.</p> 
<p>I started uploading in early 2018.</p> 
<p><img src="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2022/4780ee5b4e.png" width="600" height="410" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p> 
<p>So back to Unsplash, I've shared 505 photos that have been viewed over 152 million times, and downloaded and used over 800 thousand times, making me one of the "1000 most seen contributors ever" which is lovely.</p> 
<p><img src="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2022/e0d92a88ff.png" width="600" height="288" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p> 
<p>A problem though is my recent work. Work that is arguably better, shot on better cameras, with better lenses, and better colour grading ... because I've learned and gotten better with better gear.</p> 
<p><img src="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2022/20de8dc894.png" width="600" height="417" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p> 
<p>Of my most viewed photos "of all time" only two photos from the last year are in my top 70 images. After 70 they start appearing a little, but inside the top 70, <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/aGwwy7R7lgU">number 69</a> is a boring drone shot, and <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/7QIiGhX4L24">number 8</a> was an outlier. Luna had woken up early so the two of us wanted to go watch the sun rise, and we both took our cameras.</p> 
<p>Obviously the longer a work has been available, the more views and downloads it can get. Secondly, as Unsplash is online longer, I'm assuming more photographers are uploading more work, so the pool gets larger, and the available views and downloads may lessen.</p> <h3>When or why would I leave Unsplash?</h3> 
<p>I used to think I'd leave Unsplash when I reached 1 million downloads. But I think the truer statement is that I'd stop giving my work away for free, when it resonated with enough people who wanted to pay for it.</p> 
<p>How do I reach that number? How do I find those people? I have no idea. The only thing I know to do today is step one, to create, step two and three and four can't even happen without step one.</p> 
<p>Money is nice, but making work that resonates with people, work that makes you and I feel something. That's like a little bit nicer.</p>

<p>I met Charles Wooley when I was in line to be his producer on what’s now called the Triple M regional radio network.</p> 
<p>Smart guy, good interviewer, wasn’t going to leave Tasmania for a big radio job, so they built out the Hobart studios to accomodate him.</p> 
<p>I never took the gig, but I was impressed that someone could love where they live so much to the chagrin of a radio job.</p>

<p><strong>Looking for an Unpopular business to help</strong></p> 
<p>I'm looking for a business that needs help being found, so I can help them for free.</p> 
<p>A few months ago a friend let me know how much success he'd had from some free help I'd given him on search engine optimisation, and it ignited something in me, maybe I could help other people and make a business out of it?</p> 
<p>So I've been working on a service I think would really help people that are either starting or have fallen into a rut over the past few years, get found.</p> 
<p>It's search optimisation, not just for "search engines", but for every way people will find you. It's a minimum three-month process, but in the end, the goal is for the right people to find you in a way that is natural and normal for them.</p> 
<p>And sometimes the most obvious things are missed, like this sign to Cerritos Beach, covered in stickers.</p> 
<p>I'm looking for a business to work with for free, so I can document it and show other people who might wonder what it all looks like.</p> 
<p>And of course, if you trust me and want my help to be found, I'm taking on clients now with a money-back guarantee. If we don't reach the goals we set together, you can either take a refund on the last three month's work or get another three for free.</p> 
<p>Check out what I'm doing at <a href="https://withers.co/unpopular">withers.co/unpopular</a> and if you want help being found for free, get in touch.</p>

<p>I'm wondering whether "stay in your medium lane" is good advice for Elon Musk and Twitter today?</p> 
<p>I think about Instagram starting as a still photo medium and how I like it less as it has changed lanes. Facebook started as a "friend-to-friend connection" medium, and I like it less as Adam Mosseri has obsessed over Reels and videos.</p> 
<p>Twitter started as, and mostly still is, a text medium.</p> 
<p>The human brain likes to catalogue and silo things. Twitter is a textual medium, and all of us on it love that about it.</p> 
<p>If Twitter wants to evolve to take on YouTube and Facebook and leave text behind, that will be its death knell. Not headwinds in the marketplace, but the fact that those of us that like to read and write text, want to connect and share in a place that champions reading and writing text.</p> 
<p>That's why I<a href="https://micro.blog/joshua">moved my writing and sharing</a> to <a href="https://micro.blog/joshua">Micro.blog</a> when it launched. <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> champions text and text sharing, whilst also encouraging you to own your content/text.</p> 
<p>If anything was going to take Twitter's place today, in my humble opinion, it would be <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a>, because it has a business plan, it has a network, by design it's healthy and good for the soul, but it champions the reading and writing of text.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/11/06/im-wondering-whether.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-11-06</a></p> <hr> 
<p>Idea: The most important part of Twitter is the feeling of sending the tweet.</p> 
<p>No-one sees your tweets anyway, so what if we made a new Twitter where all your followers and replies were just GPT-3 nodes.</p> 
<p>An AI social network where computers affirm you and your thoughts.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/11/06/idea-the-most.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-11-07</a></p> <hr>
