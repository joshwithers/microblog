<p>Old people/nerds like me: Do you have memories, or photos, of the computer software and shareware kiosks from the mid-90s in Australia.</p> 
<p>I remember going to Video Ezy in Mackay (in the Canelands carpark to be precise) and you could BYO floppy disk or buy one from the staff, and there was a computer kiosk where you could choose which shareware programs you'd download to your 1.44MB floppy disk.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/11/07/sorry-i-missed.html" class="microblog_permalink">Nov 7, 2023 ↓</a> 
<p>Sorry I missed your text, I'm currently being force-fed all of the information about the entirety of the existence of the human race, past, present, and future, through a handheld slab of glass and aluminium, and my brain stopped coping in 1995.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/11/08/this-is-so.html" class="microblog_permalink">Nov 8, 2023 ↓</a> 
<p>This is so fascinating, <a href="https://www.lumafield.com/article/real-vs-fake-apple-products-through-industrial-ct-airpods-pro-macbook-magsafe-charger">CT scans of real AirPods versus the fake ripoff AirPods</a></p>

<p>Answering the most common question I get asked, "Do you travel for weddings?"</p>

<p>Watch out guys, the police have installed new air drumming detection cameras and if you actually can't play drums or if you're out of time with the music it's a $2000 fine.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/11/10/you-know-its.html" class="microblog_permalink">Nov 10, 2023 ↓</a> 
<p>You know, it’s super fun and easy to take a pot shot at the Humane AI Pin, but put your hesitations aside and 1) watch the <a href="https://vimeo.com/882968794">video</a> and tell me it’s not actually kinda cool, and 2) it’s refreshing to see someone have a crazy idea and actually get it to a stage of putting a price on it.</p> 
<p>So many big ideas never make it past a concept video. Ideas are easy. Shipping is real hard. If it was available in Aus today I’d probably give it a red hot shot because it’s just fun.</p>

<p>The hardest thing about being a wedding celebrant is figuring out the right balance of smiley faces, exclamation marks, or periods, to end sentences in emails with.</p> 
<p>You don't want to sound too cold, but you don't want to sound too excited. It's an art.</p> </div> </div>
