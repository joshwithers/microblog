<p><strong>Qantas T80 seat selection reminder shortcut for Apple Shortcuts</strong></p> 
<p>Reading a recent <a href="https://www.pointhacks.com.au/qantas/t-80-rule-best-seats/">Point Hacks email about the ol' 'T-80' Qantas rule</a> reminded me of an Apple Shortcuts shortcut I'd been meaning to make for a while. I'm no programmer, or Shortcut-writer, but I whipped the shortcut up today and I think it works really well.</p> 
<p>Stealing this next image from Point Hacks, extra seats open up 80 hours out from the flight:</p> 
<p><img src="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2022/73d3b88efc.jpg" width="600" height="337" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p> 
<p>If you'd like a reminder about that opportunity, <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/2c293f50c6ba4c4fb96e012adff0ff23">download the shortcut on your Apple device now</a>. It works on Mac, iOS, and iPadOS, basically anywhere Shortcuts works.</p> <blockquote> 
<p>This Shortcut looks for a calendar entry in the next year that has the letters QF in it, assumes that's a calendar entry about a Qantas flight, and can create a reminder 80 hours before that flight to remind you that most seats that are blocked due to status are now unlocked and you're able to select that seat if it's not already taken.</p> 
<p>It's set up to look in all calendars and create a reminder in my Travel Reminders list, but you can edit it to your liking. My Qantas flights appear as part of a Tripit calendar subscription and this works fine.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Here's how the Shortcut works:</p> 
<p>It looks through my calendar and shows me all the calendar entries coming up that contain the letters QF, luckily for us the English language doesn't afford us many words that use the letters q and f together, so it's an easy selection.</p>

<p>The Shortcut displays the flights, you choose one, and a reminder is created along with a link to the Qantas manage your booking page.</p>

<p>If you use a different calendar system or a to-do/reminders system, it should retrofit if your system talks to Shortcuts like most do these days.</p>

<p><strong>Smashing a spacecraft into an asteroid</strong></p> 
<p>Emma Elsworthy in the <a href="https://view.mail.crikey.com.au/?qs=236e7b4f2d4c6c43a288ddde12a961399681d8b872e90486e3038ed70f5d7558d8852492c951f5a18c5a6186efb7234f023ac434e3aa3cdd344eee4f5a721e4937bbf03f2d27452b13e5be28658e7945">Crikey Worm this morning</a>:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>The nerds at NASA are going to smash a spacecraft into an asteroid hurtling through space this morning. It’s going to happen about 11 million kilometres from where you’re sitting now — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6Z1E0mW2ag">and you can watch a livestream from 8am</a>. The recipient of our pummelling will be a 163-metre-wide asteroid called Dimorphos that is orbiting a larger, 780-metre-wide asteroid.</p> 
<p>It won’t be one guy and a joystick controlling the trajectory (how cool would that be?) — NASA says software will determine the point of impact. There will be a nail-biting moment in the last 50 minutes, however, when the software will need to differentiate between the larger asteroid and Dimorphos, as BBC writes.</p> 
<p>Assuming all goes well, the livestream will cut off when the spacecraft hits, but luckily a mini satellite released from the spacecraft a few days ago will record the whole shebang from 50km away. Success will be measured by whether Dimorphos’ orbit (about 12 hours at the moment) is shortened by 10 minutes. But the chances are slim that we’ll actually need to do this in future — scientists reckon we’ve identified 95% of all monster asteroids that could cause a global calamity. The other 5%, however…</p> </blockquote> <h3>Update</h3>

<p><strong>The end of the shared experience that is music</strong></p> 
<p>Larry Miller, NYU, in <a href="https://overcast.fm/+QN1ou_JdI">The Future of Music podcast on The Verge</a> hosted by Ariel Shapiro:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>"The magnitude of most hits is smaller."</p> 
<p>"We've also noticed that the amount of music being uploaded and the vast majority of the new music is never listened to."</p> 
<p>"The streaming services, including TikTok, are great at breaking a track. They're less great at breaking an artist and a career."</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Music has been such a shared experience - shared joys, shared sorrows - it's such a valuable part of our cultural fabric that I wonder what the current state of music means for the fabric yet to be spun.</p> 
<p>If I’m by myself I rarely listen to music, but with friends in the car, at concerts, or even sharing links to songs amongst us is where the songs make sense.</p> 
<p>Is the divestment of the collective music experience another pointer towards a divided people?<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/09/27/the-end-of.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-09-26</a></p> <hr>

<p>“There’s a lot of good criticism of crime reporting. It fosters systemic racism. Crimes are reported on because of the novelty factor rather than merit. A lack of follow-ups means articles rarely show the full story of a crime (including if charges are dropped). It tends to uncritically share the narrative of police, even though they are unreliable narrators. And above all else, it publicises one of the lowest moments of someone’s life and probably makes it harder for them to right the ship.”<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/09/27/cam-wilson-in.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-09-27</a></p> </blockquote> <hr>

<p>“A legitimate musical counterculture will arise, with a cadre of new artists achieving superstar status while rejecting the roles of influencer and content provider. The motto “music comes first” will be a key part of their marketing message. The movement will have a name, but that word doesn’t exist yet.”</p> 
<p>“Individuals who can identify rising talent will set up their web channels, and fill the role once played by the A&amp;R department at a record label. But there’s one big difference: they can do everything themselves without a huge corporation behind them. If these talent scouts have a web channel with a few million subscribers, they will have more clout than Sony (which, by the way, currently has a pathetic 40 thousand subscribers to its YouTube channel) or most other labels. They can sign artists, showcase them online, and build their audience—acting as sole operators, but with the influence of a big business.”<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/09/28/ted-gioias-predictions.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-09-28</a></p> </blockquote> <hr>

<p><strong>Does the Kindle Scribe replace a five year old Kindle Oasis?</strong></p> 
<p>My reading device of choice has been a Kindle Oasis (2nd model) I picked up at a Best Buy in Vegas in December 2017. It fast became my favourite little gadget. The Oasis was last updated in July 2019 - and Britt owns that model. It's got a warmth setting and a smidge larger battery, but it's basically the same.</p> 
<p>So I've been waiting patiently for an Oasis upgrade or replacement. In the meantime I just have to recharge my Kindle every two days instead of every two months, no big deal ya know.</p> 
<p>New Amazon product of the month, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/28/23375663/amazon-kindle-scribe-e-ink-tablet-stylus-event-price">Kindle Scribe</a>, has been drawing lots of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21403489/remarkable-2-e-ink-paper-tablet-review">Remarkable 2</a> comparisons, and avid readers of this blog might remember I was a <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2020/12/06/can-the-remarkable.html">big fan of my Remarkable</a>.</p> 
<p>Since that review a few things have changed:
- I sold my iPad Pro because the Apple Silicon MacBooks married with a Remarkable 2 was a happier solution.
- I've now sold my Remarkable tablet because I've been downsizing in preparation for living in Mexico and travelling around.
- My Kindle Oasis remains unchanged, but desperate for replacement.
- I've also bought an iPad Mini because size - but it's a terribly underpowered machine so that's being relegated to "TV on airplanes and buses" duty with my kids.</p> 
<p>So does the Scribe fit the Remarkable-loving, iPad-replacing, Oasis-upgrading dream I've been looking for?</p> 
<p>It seems to be a really close fit, with one exception. The Oasis would have been one of the largest Kindles produced at 7", but the Scribe is a 10.2" device, almost matching the Remarkable, and I think that's too big to lay in bed reading a book from.</p> 
<p>So we wait.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/09/30/does-the-kindle.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-09-30</a></p> <hr>
