<p>From my boy @JayT0pp's <a href="https://jaytopp.com/optin1635405785072">email</a>:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>"The tourist seeks out culture because in our world culture has disappeared into the maw of the spectacle. Culture has been torn down and replaced with a mall or a talk ­show. Because our education is nothing but a preparation for a lifetime of work and consumption-because we ourselves have ceased to create."<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/06/28/from-my-boy.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-06-28</a></p> </blockquote> <hr> 
<p><strong>"Make known the unknown; murder your fantasies</strong></p> 
<p>Craig Mod to Kai in <a href="https://www.densediscovery.com/issues/194">Dense Discovery 194</a>:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>“It’s easy to be seduced by the world of potentiality. A book is always greatest before it’s written. You are intoxicated by what it can be. That’s very dangerous. You want to kill those seductions as quickly as possible, and one way to achieve that is fast iteration.</p>

<p><strong>Off to the lawyers we go</strong></p> 
<p>I’ve always wanted to see my work published, so when my friend Justin suggested I had been in a photo book called “Australia: A Celebration”, I went investigating.</p>

<p>A few observations on flying out of the Gold Coast this morning.</p> 
<p>1) I departed through a new fancy boarding gate, they have scales in the floor to weigh carry-on stealthily. The new gates are also a bit confusing to reach.</p> 
<p>2) for the first time in over 350 flights over 20 years with Qantas my carry-on luggage was weighed and subsequently checked in as luggage, aka taken off me. Which is fine, it’s the rules. But it’s also why professionals fly Qantas, because they won’t touch our carry-on. If that bag doesn’t arrive in Melbourne, I can’t marry a couple this afternoon.</p> 
<p>3) the Qantas staff seem to be sick and tired of … gestures at everything … and can you blame them?</p> 
<p>I had 14kg over two bags and was travelling only carry-on because I have a quick transfer and I’m low on faith in the Sydney and Melbourne baggage handlers. Here’s hoping for luggage success.</p> 
<p>Over the microphone one of the crew has announced that it’s great to have us onboard, I’m sure it’s not.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/07/02/a-few-observations.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-07-01</a></p> <hr>

<p><strong>Love Gets Weird</strong></p> <blockquote> 
<p>God is love but love gets weird
Said the flea to the ant in the devil’s beard
We are passengers here, and it’s as we feared
That God is love but love gets weird</p> 
<p>Yes, God gets weird and so does love
Said the flea to the ant and gave him a shove
And came down upon him from above
Crying, God gets weird and so does love</p> 
<p>Well, Weird got Love and God got Weird
And in the monstrous morning there appeared
The very thing we’ve always feared
That God is nothing, but love gone weird</p> </blockquote>
