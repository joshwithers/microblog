<p>I shared this on Facebook six years ago, on July 24, 2017:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>Something you probably don't realise when you ask me to be your celebrant is that in celebrating your marriage, you're gleaning a little from mine.
As I prep for your ceremony I'm taking notes on you both and your definitions of marriage,m although the foundation of my belief of what marriage is and what it looks like in real life starts at home.
So with that said, I ought share some personal news about our marriage.
For almost five years Britt and I have been trying to fall pregnant, so today we took the next step and our doctor extracted 13 eggs from Britt so we could get some third party assistance in that area.</p> </blockquote>

<p>How cute is it that while you're under general anaesthetic they scribble the extraction number on your hand like you're tattooing your BFF with a biro in high school.
Life doesn't always go as you plan, that's the beauty of marriage - it's the two of you together forever regardless of how well the plan's going, or not. And because of that union, we know, that the best is yet to come.</p> </blockquote>

<p>In a story on the book 'Welcome to Sex', Amy Remeikis <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/25/yumi-stynes-big-w-sex-education-book-welcome-to-sex-jess-hill-senate-enquiry">writes in The Guardian</a>:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>The response to a sex education and consent book which was removed from the shelves of Big W stores shows how far Australia still has to go on sex education, a Senate committee inquiry has heard.
Welcome to Sex, co-authored by the former Dolly Doctor and adolescent health expert Dr Melissa Kang and feminist writer Yumi Stynes, became the target of an online protest campaign. The book was pulled from shelves at Big W after staff members were abused.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>I'm fairly done with the constant outrage in society today, the idea that we just need to be upset all day every day. It keeps journalists employed and right wing activist social media groups active. But I will say, I don't want Luna or Goldie to stumble across this book in a bookstore without me there to guide them.</p> 
<p>I have a theory that the problem with modern Australian society is that continue outsourcing jobs that families, humans, friends and partners should be doing. An example is there's a guy in a Facebook group today hiring people to be friends with disabled kids and it's NDIS funded. We've outsourced friendship to the Commonwealth. Even in COVID most didn't understand that the reasons for the lockdowns and border closures is because we have outsourced out community wellbeing to the state, so their undertaking of the 'contract' is to minimise expenses.</p> 
<p>As it is with this book, it's a vendor looking to win the contract for the outsourcing of your parenting.</p> 
<p>My worldview is that there are matters for the home, for the community, for the family, to deal with, fix, entertain, talk about.</p> 
<p>An example is my controversial opinion that I don't like abortion. I have no problem with liberal/progressive abortion laws, it's good for it to be regulated and I don't think people are just out there aborting babies like it's a fun pastime, but ultimately - in my utopian vision for the world - I'd like to see no abortion. Instead as someone is presented with the crossroads where they would consider an abortion the community would help. If money was required, they'd help. If the baby needed parenting, we'd help. That there would be a personalised, tailored solution, involving community and family compromise that resulted in the baby being born and being loved. I'm aware that my utopia does not exist, but that's just where I'd like to see society be. No need to @ me, I know that rape exists, there are medical quandaries, and sex protection doesn't always work, but I'd really simply, almost blindly stupidly just love to see babies be born and be loved. It's like a one in 400 billion chance that a baby would ever be born, I just don't want to squander it.</p> 
<p>So I have my utopian vision, and it's about communities and families taking it upon themselves to care for and love the ones within. Of course Police and governance has its place, but we should take more responsibility in the home and in the community. If I see someone litter I call them out on it, and if they're not there I pick the rubbish up and put it in the bin, that's me.</p> 
<p>So, back to the book.</p> 
<p>The main problem I see with the book is that I don't want my girls to pick it up, if I liked the books message, I would bring it to them. But the other problem in the story today is with the linking of the book and consent. It's a long shot. Consent is important, should be deeply known, understood and respected by all people.</p> <blockquote> 
<p>Chanel Contos, the founder of Teach us Consent, echoed those concerns. “Young people are learning about sex from pornography, which – a phrase I always use is that is basically like learning how to drive a car by watching Formula One,” Contos said.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>If children are learning about sex from pornography - I'll humbly admit that was my early "education", not due to my own wants but a severe lack of parental input and presence (thanks mum and dad, didn't mess me up at all) - the answer isn't to put a children's book about sex on shelves. Sure, make it available as a resource to parents who want to engage with that resource when they are ready to, but the gaping hole in Australian society today isn't lack of resource, it's leadership from parents, or as I like to call it: parenting.</p> 
<p>Australians are parenting less and less. I can talk about this from my own experience, my mother walked out when I was five, my step-mother didn't really like me, and my father worked often two to three jobs.</p> 
<p>A former Channel V host should not have to parent my children, I don't want Woolworths Group to parent my children, I want close to zero of the community group that identifies as politicians to parent my children, and regardless of education choices anyone makes the educators are not parenting our kids.</p> 
<p>Parents need to parent. Families and communities need to step up. Parents are not the kids best mates. Parents are not caregivers or landlords. Parents are leaders, leading their kids from birth to greatness - of course that greatness does include a deep and loving understanding and respect of other people's consent, and also an understanding of the concepts of sex, intercourse, dating, courting, etc.</p> 
<p>We have a set of boundaries with our kids that we will not lie to them, we will not lead them astray, but we'll also respect their need to play, rest, and learn at their speed.</p> 
<p>I'll let them learn about scissoring when their fragile-because-of-age minds can fully understand what it means. Not when they pick it up off a shelf in a book shop next to Paw Patrol.</p>

<p>I welcome resources like Welcome to Sex being made available as a resource for parents to introduce to children when they deem so, but please make a space in society for parents to parent their children in their own unique way. Don't force our hands. We don't live in a single-speed society. Our lives have a transmission, everyone's driving at different speeds at different revs using different gears, on different roads, needing to operate at different gears. Making a book this graphic and forward available for my child to just to pick up isn't the way.</p> 
<p>Create space for parents to lead their children, and maybe they will?</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/07/25/im-looking-for.html" class="microblog_permalink">Jul 25, 2023 ↓</a>

<p>One of my most-used and favourite apps is Flighty, and they've just <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1358823008">announced a new version</a> that's basically a frequent flyer's private social network. I love it!</p> <blockquote> 
<p>Flighty 3.0 is the new way to share your flying with family and friends. Keep track of your loved ones, not flight numbers. Another industry-first from Flighty.
1. Flighty Friends - Connect with family and friends once, then you can see each other trips and get alerts — automatically and ongoing. You’ll see them on your map, can choose alerts levels, and can stop sharing anytime.
2. Group Trip Ready - Your flights and friend’s flights appear together in the new Today view. Everyone’s live ETA and status make group trips easy.
3. Friends Names in Flight Alerts - Now with name, photo, and custom controls per person to avoid notification fatigue.
4. Trip Sharing - Send multiple flights at once. Receivers can add them to Flighty, or simply view them in their browser.
5. Whose Flight is That? - See who’s on each flight in your flight list, on the map, and including their seat number if you’re sharing a plane.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Add me as a friend on Flighty, yo!</p> 
<p>P.S.: Flighty is one of the very few iPhone apps I use on the regular which was quick to allow it's app to be used on Apple silicon Macs, something more developers should consider enabling.</p>

<p>Reflecting on <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/07/26/matt-mullenweg-on.html">Matt Mullenweg ten years ago reflecting on Steve Jobs/Apple's courage to release products</a>, I've been on an early morning walk down memory lane - perhaps because I woke very early and the kids are still asleep - thinking about my first few weeks with a drone camera, the original DJI Mavic Pro. It was delivered on the 28th of April 2017. I was fresh off a red eye flight from a Perth wedding the day before and straight out the door to a Tenterfield wedding that afternoon. Britt came for the drive and we put the drone up at the Airbnb.</p> 
<p><img src="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2023/088afc19-7f47-4b0c-9fdd-b1981380c880.jpg" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p> 
<p>I didn't read a manual, or the civil aviation guides. I just turned it on and thought I'd see what it did.</p> 
<p>I didn't know about aperture (or lack thereof in the original Mavic), ISO, white balance, or shooting in RAW.</p> 
<p>I just put it up in the air, mashed my fingers into the remote control, and started creating.</p> 
<p>It always has been and always will be not only my first camera, but my favourite camera.</p> 
<p><img src="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2023/5f03ae56-20f8-496b-b7fb-2af3e0c4f2cb.jpg" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p> 
<p>I've crashed a few drones, thank god for great insurance and DJI Care, lost one into a wave, and another into Queensland’s Great Sandy Bay. I've even had one fly away in Iceland due to magnetic interference!</p> 
<p>Since these early photos - seriously, all a fluke that they're ok photos - I've been so blessed to have my work experienced by so many. <a href="https://www.pexels.com/@hellojoshwithers/">24 million views on Pexels</a>, <a href="https://unsplash.com/@joshwithers">201 million on Unsplash</a>, commissioned work in a handful of places like the <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2021/04/30/my-first-photography.html">Sydney Reece showroom</a> or the Hilton Gold Coast boardroom, and in a <a href="https://priints.com/products/south-o-talle">gallery in London</a>.</p> 
<p>I've got my own <a href="https://art.josh.withers.co">fine art prints gallery</a> online that's sold about three photos, and the commissions I've received have probably covered the cost of the drones I've purchased, but regardless it brings me so much joy.</p> 
<p>I hope my photos over the last six years have meant something to you. It makes me smile looking back at these first few photos. I had no idea what I was doing, I was just making.</p>

<p>The English, said Sir John Fortescue (c. 1470), "drink no water, unless at certain times upon religious score, or by way of doing penance.", looking at reconstructions of beer consumption from the middle ages to the pre-industrial era this was only a slight exaggeration. When estimating consumption from the amount of beer provided to soldiers, convicts, and workers or reconstructing consumption from tax revenues on beer we see that the average person consumed about a liter of beer a day, this is around four times as much as consumption in modern beer-drinking countries.</p> </blockquote>

<p>Uluṟu, that beautiful monolith that captures the very essence of Australia. It's my favourite place in Australia. This iconic natural wonder is far more than an awe-inspiring spectacle - it represents the rich tapestry of indigenous heritage and gathering for ceremony.</p> 
<p>Uluṟu is intrinsically linked with the indigenous Anangu people, serving as an embodiment of their Tjukurpa - a term that captures the moral laws, spirituality, and existence of these people. Uluṟu's formation stems from a time of ancestral beings, the Dreamtime, whose stories are etched across its vast surface in the form of petroglyphs.</p> 
<p>For countless generations, Uluṟu has been a significant ceremonial site, bearing witness to rites of passage and important celebrations. This land, imprinted with the songs and dances of the Anangu, has been a part of their life's tapestry, from birth to death and every joy and hardship in between.</p> 
<p>Now, imagine breathing your marriage into life here - a site resonating with tales of love, life, and dreams, where the deep-red soil has observed centuries of human connection. A marriage ceremony at Uluṟu represents a union not only between two individuals but also a communion with our shared human legacy and the ancient rhythms of this remarkable landscape.</p> 
<p>As a wedding celebrant, my commitment at Uluṟu is to ensure that your ceremony encapsulates your story while honouring the deep-seated heritage there. In doing so, we pay tribute to the traditional custodians of this land.</p> 
<p>Joining the long line of stories woven into this sacred land, adding our mark to the generations of human experiences that Uluṟu has borne witness to.</p>

<p>The deeper I traverse into life on Planet Earth, into fatherhood, business, weddings, photography, and friendship I am ever further interested in art, making art, and making great art. </p> 
<p>So Matt Ruby's deviation from his normal comedic quick wit and observation <a href="https://mattruby.substack.com">Substack</a> into this interesting read on George Michael, his coming out, connecting Freedom with Wham and his later Freedom '90, captured all of my attention today.</p> 
<p><a href="https://mattruby.substack.com/p/what-george-michaels-greatest-song">This whole read was just really interesting</a>.</p>

<p>Amanda Holpuch in the New York Times in June 2023:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>South Koreans became a year or two younger on Wednesday after a law standardizing the way the government counts age took effect.
There are three common ways to count age in South Korea, but the government has changed its civil code to recognise one: starting from zero on a person’s date of birth and adding a year at each birthday.
This is the age-counting method used most often around the world, but it is a departure from the country’s most popular method, often called “Korean age.” Under that system, a person is considered 1 year old at birth, and a year is added to their age each Jan. 1. This meant that an infant born on Dec. 31 was considered 2 years old the next day.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Every extra square metre I experience on this planet I find new and wild ways that humans have figured out how to exist. Korean Age isn't the weirdest, but it's up there.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/07/26/in-western-australia.html" class="microblog_permalink">Jul 27, 2023 ↓</a>

<p>Update on the book writing: I wrote a lot and I thought it was ok, I ran it past some friends and it wasn't as good as I thought, and on further reflection it was worse.</p> 
<p>Then I read this in Stephen King's On Writing:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>So I'm currently reading a lot. I used to read a bit, now I'm reading a lot.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/07/27/abc-radio-nationals.html" class="microblog_permalink">Jul 28, 2023 ↓</a> 
<p>ABC Radio National's Andrew West interviewing Ian Buruma on in <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/religionandethicsreport/ian-buruma-and-the-spirit-of-woke/102643222">The religious and spiritual ethics of wokeness</a>:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>It's when a movement to improve certain social conditions, whether it's about race, gender, or whatever else, turns from an active effort into a rigid ideology, then you have a problem.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Ian originally wrote about wokeness in <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2023/07/protestant-ethic-and-the-spirit-of-wokeness/">Harpers Magazine</a>:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>Writing about “Woke” has at least two pitfalls. One is that any criticism of its excesses provokes accusations of racism, xenophobia, transphobia, misogyny, or white supremacy. The other problem is the word itself, which has been a term of abuse employed by the far right, a battle cry for the progressive left, and an embarrassment to many liberals.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Looking forward to a future where being woke is a clearer idea and status. I'm sick of wondering if I'm a sheeple or a wolk folk, and by who's definition.</p>

<p>Leaving Puglia today and I’m struck by the thought, after having experienced about thirty different international communities and societies over the last year that there is an opportunity cost to every society.</p> 
<p>I've left every community thinking "this was great, but ..." identifying trade-offs and compromises made to build that society.</p> 
<p>Like Puglia for example, I love it here, but there's no breakfast culture. In fact most of the world doesn't celebrate breakfast like Australians do, and weirdly enough that's possibly important to me.</p> 
<p>Perhaps utopia is impossible because it would simply be the longest list of compromises ever made? Perhaps getting a good breakfast means you have to live in a society where everyone bottles their feelings and pretends to be polite in traffic, as opposed to Italy where you find out how the driver feels straight away but they won't road rage you?</p> 
<p>Is that the price I want to pay for eggs Benedict and a long black with cream?</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/07/29/i-reinstalled-the.html" class="microblog_permalink">Jul 29, 2023 ↓</a>

<p>About 20 years ago, somewhere early 2003 from memory, I learned the most important lesson I'd ever been taught in broadcasting and business, from Stan Hillard:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>(When you're broadcasting) imagine the audience are the stupidest people alive, but treat them with the upmost respect.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>It's an axiom employee daily. Assuming the audience doesn't know the backstory, they don't know your reasoning or motivation, or they simply haven't been listening. It's about inclusivity, with the upmost respect for them.</p> 
<p>On a side note, in trying to find where Stan was at today, <a href="https://radiotoday.com.au/community-radio-should-be-cut-off/">I stumbled across this piece I wrote for Radio Today ten years ago</a>. Looking back it feels rude at the time but still true today.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/07/29/years-from-now.html" class="microblog_permalink">Jul 29, 2023 ↓</a> 
<p>Years from now the people of Puglia will still talk of the strange man who came from the land down under, where women glow and the men have takeaway American coffee with cold milk. I said, "Do you speak-a my language?" and they just smiled and gave me an espresso with a cold milk drink on the side.</p>

<p>Shane Parrish on fs.blog with, <a href="https://fs.blog/mental-model-hanlons-razor/">Hanlon’s Razor: Not Everyone is Out to Get You</a>, is such an encouraging read today. I was only thinking about how we more often than not think that everyone is looking at us as I was on a beach in Puglia yesterday considering very quickly stripping out of my swimmers into dry pants. I almost did until Britt suggested that everyone would see me. I still wonder whether they would have, and I think not. Most people don't notice me, don't see me, and don't know me. Even less read this blog.</p> 
<p>What is Hanlon's Razor you may ask?</p> <blockquote> 
<p>Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by neglect.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>The fs.blog article stretches the razor out to some real world artefacts: </p> 
<p>The media:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>Modern media treats outrage as a profitable commodity. This often takes the form of articles which often attribute to malice that which could be easily be explained by incompetence or ignorance.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Not everyone is out to get you.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/07/30/look-all-i.html" class="microblog_permalink">Jul 31, 2023 ↓</a>
