<p><strong>The future of creating is damned</strong></p> 
<p>My greatest fear for my kids and for future generations is what it means to create within and around such specific analytics being available.</p> 
<p>I (unfortunately) have precise readings of how many people read and view my work. Where they come from and where they don't. How many followers, likes, and shares each social network allows me.</p> 
<p>Honestly, it's depressing and it is the biggest impediment to my creative work.</p> 
<p>Efforts to remove the signals from my life have been mostly meaningless and sometimes even have adversely affected business, revenue, and our family's supply.</p> 
<p>I am most aware of this because my career as a creator started when its audience was measured by handwritten diaries, radio-listening diaries completed at the end of the day where the surveyed people would report on which radio stations they listened to - in quarter-hour blocks - throughout the day, usually reporting at the end of the day. Somehow entire industries and careers like mine were built on the back of less than 0.1% of the population writing in a book for a few weeks a year was representative of the entire local population, and we all took this as gospel.</p> 
<p>Now I know exactly that one person watched one of my YouTube videos of me talking about a chapter of my book, and they didn't even finish, and I also know that my silly Instagram Reel of my four-year-old daughter with a wavy video effect has been seen by over 100,000 people.</p> 
<p>And even if we think that 100,000 people is a great reach, it's only 0.00125% of the global population. Is 0.001% reach within our content goals this month?</p> 
<p>With the slightest margin of error, we can tell you that somewhere between 25 to 35 visit our business website every day, but somehow we make enough bookings to provide for our family.</p> 
<p>I think about the New York Times article recently published where I was quoted and our websites linked to, and it looks like pretty much zero of the article's readers clicked those links. I wonder how many people actually read the article which had taken many hours of at least one journalist's and one editor's time to research, write, and publish. The most promotion I witnessed of the article itself was a small text link at the bottom of the NY Times front page. Do people read that far down? Do they click those links? Did anyone even read that article?</p> 
<p>Things aren't bad, but there was a mysterious time only recently when you could broadcast a radio program and have no idea how many people heard it. You could print a newspaper, and obviously, you would have some idea of how many papers were printed, but who read which articles? You never knew! It was beautiful. You could write an article you thought was worth writing, that the editor thought was worth publishing, and you would just send it off to the printer along with the headline news about that scandal and the other story about how politicians are terrible.</p> 
<p>Do we still create beautiful things if we believe that no one will see them?</p> 
<p>George Berkeley wrote in A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge,</p> <blockquote> 
<p>The objects of sense exist only when they are perceived; the trees therefore are in the garden... no longer than while there is somebody by to perceive them.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>If you suppose that no one might perceive your creation, do you even create it in the first place?</p> 
<p>Are we ok with being unpopular? Are our kids ok with it?</p> 
<p>If you asked me I'd say I am ok with it, if only because it's my reality. But the truth is that this reality also affects my ability to create. I second-guess myself, wondering if it's even worth clicking the shutter button or opening up the laptop to write a chapter of a book that will most likely be purchased by only my close friends and read by even fewer.</p>

<p>As I've published this piece, and added a featured image of me trying to figure out why Morgan's Nikon camera wasn't working (if you know, you know) I've realised that all of these thoughts of mine are before and almost exclusionary of artificial intelligence and large language models.</p> 
<p>Creating really is doomed isn't it ...<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/03/06/the-future-of.html" class="microblog_permalink">2023-03-06</a></p> <hr>

<p><strong>Rancho Gaspare√±o</strong></p> 
<p>Bryan J√°uregui <a href="https://tosea.net/category/history/">quotes</a> Greg Schredder regarding Rancho Gaspare√±o, Baja California Sur, just south of Todos Santos, emphasis and photos mine:</p> 
<p><img src="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2023/3b62c732a7.jpg" width="600" height="480" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p> <blockquote> 
<p>Rancho Gaspare√±o was named after a Spanish galleon that went aground on the point, the Gaspare√±o. It was one of the so-called Manila galleons, <strong>Spanish ships that sailed between the Philippines and Acapulco for 250 years</strong>, bringing spices, silks and other luxuries from the far east to New Spain. All <strong>these galleons sailed the Pacific coast of Baja on their way to Acapulco, so naturally enough the area became riddled with pirates</strong>, many of them English and Dutch.</p> 
<p><strong>There are many tales of buried pirate treasure in the area</strong>, and local school groups still come to explore the cave at Rancho Gaspare√±o each year to tap into the lore. Treasure hunters have reason for optimism; in 1974 when the road from La Paz to the ferry terminal at Pichilingue was being built, a pirate chest of plundered loot was discovered by road workers.</p> 
<p>I think of this part of the Baja coastline as the forgotten area. People drive past Rancho Gaspare√±o going a hundred miles an hour on the new 4-lane highway and have no idea of the history of the area.</p> 
<p>The Guaycura and Pericue Indians were the original inhabitants before the Jesuit‚Äôs arrival in 1697, and they were essentially wiped out by the time the Jesuits left in 1768. The Jesuits built their theocracy based on a promise to the King of Spain to get rid of the pirates who were plundering his ships, and the pirates faded away with the demise of the Manila galleons in 1815. Dominican Padre Gabriel Gonz√°lez had a ranch near Gaspare√±o from 1825 to 1850, and the tobacco, rum, sugar, corn, and livestock he produced there made him the richest man in Baja California. <strong>From his ranch the padre engaged in espionage and guerilla warfare during the Mexican-American war of 1846-1848, and ‚Äì thanks in part to the Padre ‚Äì Mexico won a major victory near Gaspare√±o (but lost the war)</strong>. By 1855 the Padre had lost his political backing and left Baja for good. For the next one hundred years entrepreneurs made fortunes in the sugar cane industry with fields in areas like Gaspare√±o, but in the 1950s a severe drought and price drop lead to the demise of the industry; the last sugar processing plant closed in 1974. In that same year the trans peninsular highway made its way to Todos Santos, bringing new life to the town, and in 1985 renowned artist Charles Stewart arrived from Taos, planting the seed for Todos Santos‚Äô current incarnation as an artists‚Äô colony. It remains an agricultural center and surfing hotspot, only now it is firmly on the radar of major developers.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Now we all just speed past at 120km/hr on the four-lane highway and wonder <a href="https://theagencyloscabos.com/articles/rancho-gaspareno/">how much</a> the owner wants for it (shhh, <a href="https://www.internationalsurfproperties.com/listing/rancho-gaspareno-oceanfront-development/">$12M</a>).</p>

<p>You're a Miracle by Mike McHargue is a book that zings around the inside of my brain all day every day:</p> <blockquote>

But sometimes, you are a pain in your ass because all these networks are running a playbook that‚Äôs been around a lot longer than you have.

<p><strong>July: great at selling luggage, not great at supporting it</strong></p> 
<p>I feel so heartbroken when I didn't keep my word. I struggle as a parent when I make a promise - or a threat - to my girls because I want to make sure I can follow through on my word. When I fail to keep my word in friendships, family, or business, it pains me. It's why I pore over our website copy and contracts to make sure we can and will do what we promise to do.</p> 
<p>So I guess that's why I'm feeling really disappointed in one of my favourite brands: <strong>July</strong>.</p> 
<p>Flying from San Jose del Cabo to Brisbane through Los Angeles in November last year a wheel came off my <em>Checked Plus</em> July luggage somewhere between Alaska Airlines' check-in at Cabo and the luggage carousel in LAX. I'm no fool, I'm sure one of the gentle giants working in luggage handling delicately placed the bag where it needed to be and the faulty wheel just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3m5qxZm_JqM">fell off</a>.</p> 
<p>I had travel insurance on the trip, and no doubt Alaska Airlines <a href="https://resource.alaskaair.net/-/media/Images/pages/travel-info/baggage/LZ-01-Delayed-Damaged-Bag?v=5">might</a> have covered it - but I know from experience that airlines are painful about damaged luggage.</p> 
<p><img src="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2023/ca41eef695.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p> 
<p>So I had one week to make the claim with Alaska Airlines, but I thought travel insurance was the sure bet, but I know they'd ask me if I'd contacted the airline for coverage or the manufacturer for warranty, so I contacted July as I arrived on Australian soil on November 21 - intent to get a quick no from them so I can make an insurance claim, buy a new bag, and be ready to go by the time I leave Australia on December 21. We have one month to solve a hopefully easy problem.</p> 
<p>July's 'Happiness Team' replies - and by the way, unless you're actually going to make people happy, just be a customer service or customer disservice team:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>"We would be happy to have replacement wheels sent out for you."</p> </blockquote> 
<p>This I was not expecting!</p> 
<p>So I give all the details as required and requested, put to bed any thoughts of wrestling with Alsaka's premiere airline, and even worse, my travel insurance, and await the wheel.</p> 
<p>It shipped from July one month later, as I was boarding my flight to Nashville via Sydney and Dallas. I explicitly communicated that I was in the country for a month and it took a month to send the wheel.</p> 
<p>Another wheel was then allegedly shipped to my Mexican address but it's been three months and all I am left with now is a series of thoughts and no wheels.</p> <ul> <li>going to "the media" aka social media or the news never works, until it does</li> <li>I really like the July suitcases and kind of enjoy having a matching set of five despite one limping</li> <li>we're in Baja California Sur for another month until we go to Nashville and Hawaii then Europe before coming home in August, what am I going to do about this three-wheeled bag.</li> <li>I'd really just like another big July bag but do I want to continue to do business with a company that can't simply keep its word?</li> <li>I wish they'd just said no back in November and I would have bought a new bag and they would have never experienced the pain of letting me down.</li> <li>Can I even get a July bag in, or to, Mexico before April 8?<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/03/10/july-great-at.html" class="microblog_permalink">2023-03-10</a> </li> </ul> <hr>
