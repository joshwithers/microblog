<p>In 2003 Pusha T wrote the McDonald's "I’m Lovin’ It" jingle, and because he wasn't properly compensated he's now <a href="https://twitter.com/pusha_t/status/1505937547498819592?s=21">worked on a collab with Arby's and it's amazing</a></p>

<p>In light of the Hillsong news getting around, I've been reading <a href="https://amzn.asia/5gJ6akB">Beyond Belief: How Pentecostal Christianity Is Taking Over the World</a> by Elle Hardy on Pentecostal faith:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>"A powerful and globally connected religious movement, its resurgence in the twenty-first century also represents a crisis of spirituality in today’s world—one founded on consumption and individualism that replicates the social and political chaos of our time."<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/03/22/in-light-of.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-03-22</a></p> </blockquote> <hr>

<p>A real estate colleague asked me yesterday how I marketed myself in weddings. I said, I just did really good work and then people enquired. Like this couple.</p> 
<p>Breaks my heart to say no to international work at the moment, but it's not sustainable whilst there are still border variables.</p>

<p>The shopping centre across the road was on fire, so our real estate office is now a temp daycare centre for the 70 kids from Busy Bees. Because I'm a father of two I know how to be responsible around children so I'm sneaking packet sugars to the children.</p>

<p><strong>The Polestar O₂ concept car that will never ship has a built-in drone and now I hate every other car</strong></p> <blockquote> 
<p>“Cinematic drone, standard.
Polestar O₂ doesn’t just elevate the driving experience. It also allows you to record it. Housed in the rear is a cinematic drone that can lift off and land while the car is in motion. It operates autonomously, allowing the driver to select atmospheric or action-filled sequences. When the O₂ is parked, videos can be edited and shared directly from the centre display. Deploy the drone. Document the drive. And capture the fun of premium electric performance.”</p> </blockquote>
