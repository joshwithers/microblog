<p>Prediction: Wedding photography is about to undergo a massive change.</p> 
<p>The people who hold cameras like
Fuji/Sony/Canon/Nikon need to figure out how to get their JPEGs right in camera.</p> 
<p>They might still deliver a cull of 30 odd photos a week or three later, but the expectation is moving to fast turnaround.</p> 
<p>The lovely iPhone holding kids - content creators - will fade away as professionals figure out how to deliver in minutes instead of months. Or maybe they don’t fade but they take up the bottom end of the marketer.</p> 
<p>The added benefit is that because of the increased efficiency, wedding photographers will be able to take on more work. Where a wedding might have been five to ten days work, so you would be limited to maybe 30-40 weddings a year, accounting for seasonal influxes, now that same photographer might take on double the work to achieve same pay, effectively reducing the price of wedding photography because it requires less energy and effort.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2024/03/08/a-lovely-qantas.html" class="microblog_permalink">Mar 8, 2024 ↓</a> 
<p>A lovely Qantas flight attendant yesterday asked me if I was Josh Withers, at which point I prepare myself to say yes and have a chat to her about a wedding of mine that she attended or how she saw me on TV, like the D-Grade celebrity fool I am.</p> 
<p>But no, she goes on to say how my wife is lovely and amazing. The flight attendant was planning to get married and was considering eloping so she ends up on the phone with Britt talking about eloping with The Elopement Collective.</p> 
<p>Anyway, Britt really is all that and more, you know.</p> 
<p>I was planning on singing her praises today anyway but I’ve opened up the old social media today and found it to be International Women’s Day, so it’s an even better reason to scream her name from the rooftops.</p> 
<p>Not only is she the best person in my world, plus she made me a father of two of my other favourite humans, but Britt also spends countless hours each week counselling the brides and grooms of Australia about getting married, whether they should elope or not and whether or not we’re the best place for them to do that.</p> 
<p>I’ve always said the thing about being remarkable is that remarkable people are easily remarked on, you are able to remark on them because their talent, beauty, smarts, intelligence is so easily witnessed.</p> 
<p>You’re remarkable, Brittany Withers.</p>
