<p>The duo behind Instagram - who sold for good coin and then left Instagram/Facebook in 2018 - have a new thing and it's right in my ballpark. Think TikTok's algorithmic feed but for text: <a href="https://artifact.news/">artifact.news</a>.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/01/31/the-duo-behind.html" class="microblog_permalink">2023-01-31</a></p> <hr> 
<p>From <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780310358626">Love Matters More</a> by Jared Byas 📚</p> <blockquote> 
<p>"Social media encourages the myth that who we are is defined by the opinions we type. But the older I get, the less interested I am in how well people can script their beliefs in front of a computer and the more interested I am in how tenaciously they go about grinding out their moral existence. I’m impressed when someone can get up every single day, determined to be a better human being than he or she was yesterday. Typing out what we “stand for” is easy. But loving well isn’t. I am not down on typing out our opinions—clearly. I’m only down on thinking that typing in and of itself constitutes an ethical life. May we stop thinking that becoming the kind of person we want to be is as easy as typing “me too” at those we agree with and “stupid people” at those we don’t. That’s a distraction from the real work of being human. And I’m ready to work."<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/01/31/from-love-matters.html" class="microblog_permalink">2023-01-31</a></p> </blockquote> <hr>

<p>Don't believe everything AI tells you. This bio sounds right, but it's not. From what I understand I've never been in Vogue, The Knot, or Martha Vomit Stewart Weddings. I am not a founding member of the AFCC, and I've not been Sydney-based for over a decade. I also don't write my couple's vows.</p>

<p>The most Mexican thing I've seen yet is a guy who has a table to sell so he's just carried it around the neighbourhood singing out if anyone wants to buy a table. Take that, Zuckerberg, and your stupid Marketplace.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/02/01/the-most-mexican.html" class="microblog_permalink">2023-02-01</a></p> <hr>

<p>In <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781984823267">You're a Miracle (and a Pain in the Ass)</a> by Mike McHargue 📚:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>"You are a miracle because 86 billion neurons in your brain form into thousands of structures and networks, built from a map created over billions of years to understand the world you live in. But sometimes, you are a pain in your ass because all these networks are running a playbook that’s been around a lot longer than you have. The cells in your body have survived through the eons by eating every delicious calorie they come across, allowing fear to make them run, and using anger to make them fight for their lives."<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/02/01/in-youre-a.html" class="microblog_permalink">2023-02-02</a></p> </blockquote> <hr> 
<p>Anthony shared this signed cover art in today's edition of <a href="https://thesizzle.com.au/">The Sizzle</a> and very few images can conjure up so much nostalgia. I still remember visiting the shareware kiosk (computer in a box) at Video Ezy and downloading the shareware version of Doom onto two 3.5" floppy disks.</p>
