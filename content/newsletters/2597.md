<p><strong>Three reasons why Mastodon will succeed followed by three reasons Mastodon will fail</strong></p> 
<p>1) Mastodon‚Äôs celebration of the open web, the indie web, is an evergreen celebration that enough people, me included, will always get onboard with.</p> 
<p>2) Mastodon is everything we‚Äôre looking for in Twitter except it‚Äôs not Twitter.</p> 
<p>3) No one single ego can rule the Mastodon, fediverse, indieweb, open web. Instead many many egos can, will, and do.</p> 
<p>4) Mastodon isn‚Äôt a complete social media product, still requiring many features to even gain parity with what the average internet user considers the bare minimum for a social networking product. Today I couldn‚Äôt upload a video because it was too good of a quality.</p> 
<p>5) The business model of Mastodon/the Fediverse is missing links that only generosity can complete. Which is nice amongst friends. But all of us generous admins, hosts, mods have our limits (or jobs, kids, relationships). That‚Äôs the strength begging Micro.Blog, $5 a month and you‚Äôre good.</p> 
<p>6) It‚Äôs actually a lot of work and resource to run a Mastodon instance still. Digital Ocean‚Äôs $200 free spend will run out soon.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/12/01/three-reasons-why.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-12-01</a></p> <hr> 
<p>Today is day 10 away from my family. I embarked on this trip to Australia thinking I‚Äôd get lots of sleep and rest from being a dad. Instead of barely slept and miss them like crazy. Please don‚Äôt tell them, they already hold too much power over me.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/12/01/today-is-day.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-12-01</a></p> <hr> 
<p>Today milestones:</p> 
<p>11yrs ago Rhi and Jarryd became official.
10yrs ago Rhi found me on Instagram.
9 yrs ago I quit 4BC, went full time as a celebrant, and got on Nine‚Äôs Today Show as the ‚Äúcelebrant that only does cool weddings‚Äù ü§Æ
Today I married Jarryd &amp; Rhi at sunrise in the Byron Bay rainstorm before flying to Hobart.</p>

<p>Annie-B Parson:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>‚ÄúSocial media forms are performative solo forms with an odd conflation of friendship and marketing; the body is alone in a room performing the self, with an undercurrent of desire for applause. Without a town square to gather in and hash out the day with neighbors, social media communications have a shading of loneliness underneath.‚Äù<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/12/02/annieb-parson-social.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-12-02</a></p> </blockquote> <hr> 
<p>The couple I married today at Freycinet‚Äôs Honeymoon Bay married in secret (after booking me four years and a pandemic ago) so I tried my hand at double-exposures and blurry photos.</p>
