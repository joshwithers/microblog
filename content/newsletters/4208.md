<p>Aidos was actually the Greek goddess of shame, modesty, respect, and humility. Aidos, as a quality, was that feeling of reverence or shame which restrains men and women from wrong. It also encompassed the emotion that a rich person might feel in the presence of the impoverished, that their disparity of wealth, whether a matter of luck or merit, was ultimately undeserved.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/05/09/ancient-greek-terms.html" class="microblog_permalink">2023-05-09</a></p> </blockquote> <hr> 
<p><strong>The genesis story of Apple computers</strong></p> 
<p>I've been thinking about this story from Steve Jobs, recalled in 1996 and told in the new book <a href="https://book.stevejobsarchive.com"><em>Make Something Wonderful</em></a>, about how and why he and Steve Wozniak started Apple:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>The reason we (Woz and I) built a computer was that we wanted one, and we couldn’t afford to buy one. They were thousands of dollars at that time. We were just two teenagers. We started trying to build them and scrounging parts around Silicon Valley where we could. After a few attempts, we managed to put together something that was the Apple I. All of our friends wanted them, too. They wanted to build them. It turned out that it took maybe fifty hours to build one of these things by hand. It was taking up all of our spare time because our friends were not that skilled at building them, so Woz and I were building them for them.</p> 
<p>We thought if we could just get what’s called a printed circuit board, where you could just plug in the parts instead of having to hand-wire the whole thing, we could cut the assembly time down from maybe fifty hours to more like an hour. Woz sold his HP calculator, and I sold my VW Microbus, and we got enough money together to pay someone to design one of these printed circuit boards for us. Our goal was to just sell them as raw printed circuit boards to our friends and make enough money to recoup our calculator and transportation.</p> 
<p>What happened was that one of the early computer stores, in fact, the first computer store in the world, which was in Mountain View at the time, said, “Well, I’ll take fifty of these computers, but I want them fully assembled.” Which was a twist that we’d never thought of.</p> 
<p>We went and bought the parts to build one hundred computers. We built fifty of them and delivered them. We got paid in cash and ran back and paid the people that sold us parts. Then we had the classic Marxian profit realization crisis, which was our profit wasn’t liquid—it was in fifty computers sitting on the floor.</p> 
<p>We decided we had to start learning about sales and distribution so that we could sell the fifty computers and get back our money. That’s how we got in the business. We took our idea (for the computer) to a few companies, one where Woz worked (Hewlett-Packard) and one where I worked at the time (Atari). Neither one was interested in pursuing it, so we started our own company.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>I'm interviewing newly appointed marriage celebrants for a podcast project at the moment and some don't have a fire in their belly as to why they started. Their genesis story is missing some heart and soul. I think about them and whether they have staying power like the two Steves who just built computers because they wanted one. That early fire is valuable.</p>

<p>The playlist in the French cafe I'm sitting in just went from contemporary hits to one of the songs from Star Wars. Wild taste here.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/05/09/the-playlist-in.html" class="microblog_permalink">2023-05-09</a></p> <hr> 
<p>My favourite thing to do in the big cities of the world is to ignore the must-do lists, the must-see places, the hotspots and the icons, and to just walk around and exist in a different big city. Walking down random streets, getting bad coffee at little-known cafes, and finding the unseen parts of a city.
The towers, cathedrals, arches and museums are cool and we inevitably end up there.
But there’s something really interesting to me about experiencing another people’s normal.</p>

<p><strong>Paris’s NFT Factory</strong></p> 
<p>I stumbled across and subsequently visited an <a href="https://nftfactoryparis.com">NFT art gallery</a> in Paris today whilst walking the streets with Luna and trying to escape the rain. The art curated inside was wild and beautiful, and a joy to take in, but I also had the opportunity to talk to the curator who shared openly about their business model and passion for showcasing, sharing, and encouraging art.</p> 
<p>They typically curate the pieces showcased but they have open weeks where creators can buy a spot on the wall, and other weeks creators can rent the whole gallery.</p> 
<p>I’m still trying to figure out how <a href="https://art.josh.withers.co">my art</a> works and matters in the world - besides giving it away for free on <a href="https://unsplash.com/@joshwithers">Unsplash</a> and <a href="https://www.pexels.com/@hellojoshwithers/">Pexels</a> - but after visiting the gallery today I’m convinced that NFTs will have life and purpose long after the cryptobros move their hype engine somewhere else.</p> 
<p>I even <a href="https://rainbow.me/0xC2F78D865FC4D179e74E61b92eA9233d5a61408d?family=indigo-x-evelyn-o&amp;nft=0x40d69e63129c3524dc7e7abcbf401fc35668f998_3">picked up a piece</a> that Luna loved.</p> 
<p>It would be amazing to see my photos on a wall like that.</p>

<p><strong>Apple Shortcut for recording photography metadata</strong></p> 
<p>I'm passionate about making photos, but I have a sub-passion in recording good metadata around those photos as they enter my iCloud Photo Library so the photos become more useful as they age. Whether they are used in Photo Memories, like "Paris 2023" and "Early Mornings with Luna", or whether I want to search on the Photo's "Places" function to find that photo I made ten years ago, the metadata is important to me.</p> 
<p>When I shoot on my iPhone, the metadata is collected (normally), and if I have remembered to force quit and re-open the Canon Camera Connect app that day, when I shoot on my Canon EOS R5 the metadata is recorded, but if I shoot on Britt's Fujifilm digital camera or my Leica film camera, no metadata is recorded by the camera.</p> 
<p>In the <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=The+Before+Time">before time</a>s people used <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com">notepads</a> with pens, which is a lovely prospect, but I have an iPhone in my pocket and a Watch on my wrist. So I made an Apple Shortcut that will record the metadata in time and in place for later use, either with an EXIF editor or my personal go-to app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id914457352">Metapho</a> on the iPhone. (If you know of a Metapho competitor I'd be keen to hear it, I like Metapho but it feels forgotten by the developer and is sometimes buggy)</p> 
<p>So these shortcuts will simply make a new Apple Note for the day if there isn't one already and record time and place, or if you use the second shortcut that dictates a note, also that text note.</p>

<p>I activate them either by tapping the home screen icon which is easy, or by asking Siri to "Record photography location".</p> 
<p>Feel free to use, edit, mix, re-make, and share as you find useful and beneficial for the art of making photography.</p> 
<p>Much gratitude to <a href="https://talk.automators.fm/t/a-shortcut-to-record-photography-metadata-as-youre-shooting/15727">Kyle Lines in the Automators Forum</a> for helping me get the shortcuts over the line and useful for the greater population.</p>

<p><strong>Paris’s final metre</strong></p> 
<p>You’ve heard of the final mile. This is the final metre.</p> 
<p>Up until 1791 they’d been measuring things without any care for a standard, much like the USA today, but then the French astronomers Delambre and Méchain measured 10 millionths of the distance from the North Pole to the Equator through a Paris meridian, and then the government of the day installed 16 demonstrator metres around the city.</p> 
<p>This is the last one in its original installation. There’s one other that’s been moved so who even knows if it’s legit ¯_(ツ)_/¯ </p>
