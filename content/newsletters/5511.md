<p>The lead singer responsible for bringing this century its greatest motivational pop/ska punk/power pop song, All Star, has passed away.</p> 
<p><a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/smash-mouth-frontman-steve-harwell-dies-at-56/">Pitchfork</a>:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>Steve Harwell, the founding singer of Smash Mouth, died today at his home in Boise, Idaho, of liver failure, The New York Times reports. The musician was 56 years old. Harwell dealt with alcoholism and numerous health issues in the years preceding his death. </p> </blockquote> 
<p>Smash Mouth undeniably left a dent on pop culture from 1999 onwards, and when I saw the band perform in November 2018 it was stale performance from a tired Steve with a team of young local musos behind him, yet the songs struck that joyful chord in my born-in-1981 heart.</p> 
<p>But I want to leave you with Steve’s 2003 cover of Neil Diamond’s You Are My Number One.</p> <blockquote> 
<p>Hold me down
I'm gonna fly straight to heaven
Hold me down
Dont ever let go
I've been around
You know I can't stay forever
And when I leave
I want you to know -
When I'm finally gone, I'm gonna be gone without a trace
There's a lot of good times ahead before we're done</p> </blockquote> 
<p>As someone commented on X, with Jimmy Buffet passing it’s not a great week for guys who liked to party, but it seems like Steve was self-aware enough to know that all of our days are numbered.</p> 
<p>I just hope the girl with the shape of an L on her forehead had nothing to do with this.</p>

<p>Many thanks to the airline gods for offering up a new CEO for our national flights of Australia for make benefit glorious nation of Qantastralia! May our new blessed CEO that is the one and only decision maker in the entire organisation, no board of directors or any other executive staff. Make good our glorious airline that can now do no wrong and only make good decisions. Whoever the former CEO was, whatever their name, sexuality, or ethnicity was - I forget - may that bad person be forever gone to go lead some European airline far, far away, from our great nation.</p> 
<p>Qantas forever!</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/09/05/i-often-wonder.html" class="microblog_permalink">Sep 5, 2023 ↓</a>

<p>I’ve driven 737km today, I have 93 left, and I just want to say there needs to be a royal commission into the state of servo food in this once great nation.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/09/07/most-of-us.html" class="microblog_permalink">Sep 7, 2023 ↓</a> 
<p>Most of us, me included, can barely think past the next three minutes. We operate in this fear of lack, lack of good or sleep or money, that completely ignores the long arc of our life which gives us decades of evidence that we haven’t gone without yet, and all trend lines point to us being fine in the future.</p> 
<p>That’s one of the elements of marriage I love so much.</p> 
<p>In marriage you’re forced - by its very nature - to acknowledge that your life is far bigger than this three minute period of stress and anxiety we’re currently facing - in fact we have a whole life ahead of us, and considering that big picture, it’d be great to have someone else in it.</p> 
<p>I’m so glad I got over myself long enough to realise that my big picture was missing you, Britt, thank you for making it so much better by simply being you.</p> 
<p>Happy 11th anniversary xx</p>

<p>Books hold most of the secrets of the world, most of the thoughts that men and women have had. And when you are reading a book, you and the author are alone together—just the two of you. A library is a good place to go when you feel unhappy,  for there, in a book, you may find encouragement and comfort. A library is a good place to go when you feel bewildered or undecided, for there, in a book, you may have your question answered. Books are good company, in sad times and happy times, for books are people—people who have managed to stay alive by hiding between the covers of a book.</p> </blockquote>
