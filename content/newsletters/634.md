<p>“There is perhaps no more colossal waste of human potential than Netflix. An algorithmic content feeding tube, designed by Silicon Valley engineers to deposit dopamine into our lizard brains at the exact point that we would churn, Netflix’s final form will be a pair of wires shoved directly into our eyeballs giving us personally crafted reality television.

<p><a href="https://thehustle.co/how-ikea-tricks-you-into-buying-more-stuff/">The Hustle</a> via <a href="https://weekendbriefing.substack.com/p/weekend-briefing-no-421">Kyle Westaway</a>:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>"Sixty percent of IKEA purchases are impulse buys. And IKEA’s own creative director has said that only 20% of the store’s purchases are based on actual logic and needs.</p> 
<p>How does IKEA trick you into buying more stuff? (1) Store layout.  Inside, customers are led through a preordained, one-way path that winds through 50-plus room settings. The average IKEA store is 300k sq. ft.—the equivalent of about five football fields—and their typical shopper ends up walking almost a mile. This forces wider product exposure, creates a false sense of scarcity and creates mystery. (2) Low prices. IKEA often follows a “price first, design later” philosophy: It starts with a price target—say $6.99 for a new stool—then reverse-engineers the design process to meet that goal. IKEA seems to adhere to a “survival of the fittest” pricing model: If a product’s price can’t be reduced over time, it tends to get discontinued. (3) The IKEA Effect. We have a cognitive bias wherein we place a higher value on items we build ourselves, regardless of the quality of the end result. (4) Cafeteria. A survey of 700 shoppers found that those who ate at the food court spent an average of more than two times more on home furnishings than those who didn’t."<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/03/06/the-hustle-via.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-03-06</a></p> </blockquote> </div>
