<p>Happy Star Wars Day!</p> 
<p>I saw Episode 1 at the cinema this week and I’ve got a hot take.</p> 
<p>Jar Jar Binks is an important character and the people that hate him, hate him because they see their clumsy selves in Jar Jar and they need to talk to their therapist about it.</p> 
<p>Also, adding midi-chlorians to the Star Wars canon was weird. Welcome to my TED Talk.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-04/777-partners-the-private-equity-firm-behind-bonza/103802624">This reporting on the mysterious 777 Partners and it's Australian investment in airline, Bonza</a> is a good read and good reporting by Ian Verrender and the ABC.</p> <blockquote> 
<p>Virgin Blue executive Tim Jordan, claimed from the outset that he needed 10 aircraft to make the new operation viable. When he called in administrators this week, he had just four.</p> 
<p>The large Boeing 737s are arguably the wrong fit for Bonza, flying second and third-tier routes, and appear to have been used as a means to soak up the US backer's fleet and provide it with income.</p> </blockquote> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2024/05/04/ive-realised-that.html" class="microblog_permalink">May 4, 2024 ↓</a> 
<p>I've realised that I am not equipped enough to manage replies to my actual Mastodon account - <a href="https://micro.blog/withers@social.lol">@withers@social.lol</a> - and my Micro.Blog account, <a href="https://micro.blog/hello@joshwithers.blog">@hello@joshwithers.blog</a> - so I'm totally migrating my Fediverse life to the omglol kingdom. This is the way.</p> </div> </div>
