<p>This psych study is going to set the metal world on fire: “<a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-76738-001">Extreme metal guitar skill: A case of male–male status seeking, mate attraction, or byproduct?</a>”</p> <blockquote> 
<p>“there is evidence that playing music increases male attractiveness”</p> 
<p>“Extreme metal is a genre that is heavily male-biased”</p> 
<p>“musicians in this genre heavily invest their time in building technical skills (e.g., dexterity, coordination, timing), which raises the question of the purpose behind this costly investment”</p> 
<p>“This study explores the idea that heterosexual male metal guitarists are motivated to invest heavily in getting good at guitar to primarily impress other men.”<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/09/23/this-psych-study.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-09-22</a></p> </blockquote> <hr>

<p>Good advice for people who have been Optus customers since 2017, I have been one, is to enact a credit freeze. <a href="https://www.idcare.org/fact-sheets/credit-bans-australia#:%7E:text=You%20can%20apply%20for%20bans,to%20their%20terms%20and%20conditions">IDCARE has a fact sheet on freezing your credit</a>.</p> 
<p>A credit freeze means no-one, including you, can apply for credit in your name.</p> 
<p>Talking about caring about identification, an Australian institution like that not using a .au domain name is a little triggering IMHO.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/09/23/good-advice-for.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-09-23</a></p> <hr>

<p>Sitting at the next table from a group of people attending an NRL conference (wearing NRL logo shirts) and one guy jokingly says “fucking Polynesians” and now they’re joking about women in a sexist way.</p> 
<p>They were joking about a Tongan guy not present and this isn’t the racism and sexism the news is looking for today (despite being quite off colour). But, I reckon every single human inside our national sports codes needs to understand that they’re getting a pretty bad reputation for their racism and sexism and maybe a hotel foyer bar isn’t the place for it. Maybe the entire globe isn’t, but let’s start with whilst you’re at work?<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/09/23/sitting-at-the.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-09-23</a></p> <hr>

<p><strong>40 months wait and I’m pretty sure I’m never going to see this Playdate</strong></p> 
<p>It all started when I read this May 2019 <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/05/playdate">Daring Fireball</a> article and fell in love with a little gadget I’d only just heard of.</p> 
<p>I subscribed for updates straight away.</p>

<p>Passing through Heathrow Airport the next month allowed this Aussie to buy a copy of Edge Magazine and read the beautiful review.</p> 
<p><img src="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2022/53f55ca5c6.jpg" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p> 
<p>The rest of 2019 occurs, 2020 is dropped on us like an atomic bomb and I’m left waiting, ever so patiently.</p> 
<p>Then, at the end of July 2021 I got a pre-order in, a few hours after the rest of the fans in USA timezones did, so I got to Group 3.</p>

<p>2022 arrives and we as a family decide to go on sabbatical, pack up shop in Australia, hit the road and travel around Mexico.</p> 
<p>Two weeks before our flight, I get this update.</p>

<p>Patrick O'Shaughnessy on the <a href="https://manual.withcompound.com/chapters/patrick-oshaughnessy-part-i">power of audio</a>:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>"Audio feels to me like a secret hiding in plain sight. Everyone loves to learn, everyone loves content and loves consuming it, and it seems as though no matter how much great content is created, there's not enough of it. I find myself all the time without a great piece of content to consume. And the demand-supply thing just hasn't reached an equilibrium yet, maybe it never will. And audio is unique in the sense that it is at least 10 times easier to create an unbelievable hour of audio for me, and my format's interview, interviewing someone great like David. That episode between him and I took an hour and a half to record. It will probably be listened to, my guess is, millions of times by the time it's all said and done. An hour and a half for millions of listens. And people will listen all the way through, and they'll consume it all. If you translated that conversation into text, it would be about the length of a short book. If we wanted to create a book of similar quality, it would take a year, probably. I mean I've written a book, it took me a year, and my book was not nearly as good as that conversation with David was."<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/09/25/patrick-oshaughnessy-on.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-09-25</a></p> </blockquote> <hr>

<p><strong>It’s 2022 and there’s no real solution for blisters yet</strong></p> 
<p>Started this morning in a cheap Brisbane hotel with a 4am alarm and a 6:05am flight at gate 16, which became a 6:05am flight at gate 26, which transformed into a 7am flight back at gate 16, and it’s just changed it’s haircut so it’s now a 7:15am flight at gate 16. I’m excited to see the journey this Qantas flight takes.</p> 
<p>Hwoever, this most definitely is the wrong week to be breaking in new Blundstones.</p> 
<p>It’s 2022 and there’s no real solution for blisters yet. How is this?<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/09/26/its-and-theres.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-09-25</a></p> <hr> 
<p>If I was going to make a travel vlog this week my episode would be about how you should just stay at home again, airports are terrible, it’s quicker to walk. All hail HRH Lord Joyce, decider of all airborne transport matters.</p> 
<p>Formally: todays flight issues involved a B727 being ill, and then Rockhampton’s Air Traffic Control being unstaffed until 9:30am so we have to wait in Brisbane until there’s air traffic control.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/09/26/if-i-was.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-09-25</a></p> </div>
