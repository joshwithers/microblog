<p>Cuddling Goldie after a late night diaper change and I was contemplating how she and Luna have slept under almost 37 roofs since we left home in September and we have seven left. Some kids won’t go to the bathroom outside of home, but these kids just take it all in their stride. I’m a proud dad.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/06/14/travelling-with-children.html" class="microblog_permalink">Jun 15, 2023 ↓</a> <h3>Travelling with children advice</h3> 
<p>I was asked recently about advice for travelling with young children.</p> 
<p>My family including our now 4.5 and 2 year olds, left home almost a year ago and I have this advice: after about 37 accomodations and eight countries.</p> <ul> <li>Travel light. Lighter than you think. Bring as little stuff as possible.</li> <li>Lots of snacks. More than you think you need.</li> <li>Make iPad/TV shows a special treat. Fish out the special treat when necessary for sanity or social goodwill like in a line, stuck in a train or plane cabin, or a restaurant.</li> <li>Discipline your kids lovingly, positively, and well in private so they are awesome humans when in public.</li> <li>Teach your kids to be bored and look out the window.</li> <li>Figure out what kind of daily sleep/wake/activity routine or schedule works best for your kids and run with it so that all of you have a good day and you're not dragging your kids through a hike they were never going to enjoy.</li> <li>Expect to see and do far less things than you imagined. If we do one travel or touristy thing a day that's a win. Two is a big day. Three is a mistake.</li> <li>When in lines at immigration or other important things, and they’re really unhappy, just grin and bare it. It’s a few minutes of everyone’s life, we’ll all be fine, and all the other assholes around you have been expecting the tantrum anyway. If people look at us or comment on a tantrum, I just joke about it like “sorry, she just learned about taxes” or “sorry, this is my first abduction and it’s not really going well.”</li> <li>Teach your kids their names, ages, and your names so that when police come for you after you make a joke about abductions you can prove they’re yours. Make sure they know not to joke about who their parents are and what their names are.</li> <li>Bring extra dummies/soothers.</li> <li>We swear by the Phil &amp; Ted's Travel Cot version 5. Not sponsored. We've tried the rest, the Bugaboo is awesome, Phil &amp; Ted's is better.</li> <li>We also swear by the BabyZen YoYo and/or the Baby Jogger City Tour travel prams. The rest are not as good. Not sponsored. But come on guys, send us money.</li> <li>When boarding flights ask the staff where to "put the kids" as if you're expecting them to not sit with you. Say it with a straight face, and kind of hold the child out toward the staff, gesturing that they can take them now.</li> <li>Book accomodation that is walkable to public transport and parks. Nothing else in your life matters more than a good playground. Also look for accomodation with cooking facilities, you're going to want to cook at home.</li> <li>Whatever you order for them at a restaurant will not be good enough so share meals. Encourage them to try new foods. Our mantra is that you can't say you don't like something if you haven't tried it yet.</li> <li>Almost all long queues can be skipped if you are a family, or if you accidentally go down the not-foreign-passport line, or if your kids has a tantrum. Turn that lemon into line-skipping lemonade.</li> <li>I've got VLC installed on my phone with a series of old school TV shows offline like Franklin the Turtle. Old school slow TV shows are better than the visual cocaine that modern kids shows are. Damn you, Paw Patrol.</li> <li>Take a million photos. Sync them with iCloud Photo Library so when you drop your phone in the Mediterranean Sea you're not devastated. Buy disposable film cameras for the kids to make them feel involved.</li> <li>Each of our girls has a plush snuggle toy that has come with them the whole journey. When you're changing accomodation every few days a common smell and feel is a godsend.</li> <li>I’m lucky to have travelled so much with Qantas that I have a Qantas Platinum status which gets us more luggage and airport lounges with OneWorld airlines worldwide, this is so good with kids. Everyone in the Oneworld First Class Lounge thinks they’re having a fancy aviation with champagne moment but then in runs my two year old ready to bring hell. It’s my favourite part of every flight.</li> <li>Snacks. Water. Lots of snacks.</li> <li>My kids like to play with tape so we have random coloured kid’s sticky tape for them to play with on flights. The water-painting kits for kids are awesome, they come with a water “brush” and it reacts with the board, so they think they’re painting but it’s zero mess apart from some water. So many books as well, we’ll buy, read, and donate books regularly.</li> <li>Sleep. So much sleep.</li> <li>There’s no greater experience than allowing your kids to sulk in different cultural settings.</li> <li>I use the Anker 4-port chargers and buy the figure 8 lead for the appropriate country, then make sure everything we own is USB chargeable.</li> </ul> 
<p>These experiences and memories will be priceless. Be in the moment for them all.</p>

<p>There’s no kangaroos in Austria.</p> 
<p>You know what’s funny about our time in Austria is that I knew nothing about the country a few weeks ago, my main exposure being when I would be in America or Mexico, introducing myself a an Australian and they’d think I said Austrian and make some stupid comments about how they have always wanted to visit Europe. But thanks to a tip from a friend who recommended renting a car in Vienna because it’s cheaper than Italy, we’re exploring Austria and loving it!</p>

<p>Driving across Austria this week we've seen plenty of castles, we even stayed in one, and every sighting of one is pretty special.</p> 
<p><img src="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2023/564f15eecb.jpg" alt="Castle Itter, Austria" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p> 
<p>There's one near us which looks very much like a castle, and tonight on our last night in Hopfgarten I found out the history of the castle on <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/castle-itter">Atlas Obscura</a> and it's the most interesting of stories:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>In the final weeks of the European theater of World War II, an unexpected union of German and American forces guarded a select group of abandoned Nazi prisoners against the Waffen-SS. The conflict fought by this unique joint American-German alliance is frequently referred to as the strangest battle of World War II.</p> 
<p>Castle Itter was first built in the ninth century by the Bavarians and spent many years as a private residence. In May of 1943, after the Anschluss of Austria, it was transformed into a prison. For two years, French captives considered to be of high value were confined within its walls.</p> 
<p>But as Stephen Harding writes in The Last Battle, those prisoners eventually found themselves unguarded and thrust into a precarious position. Days after Hitler died by suicide, it became clear the war had reached a turning point. The commander and warden of the prisoners at Castle Itter abandoned their posts, knowing the end of the war was near. The remaining guards also fled, essentially giving the castle to those imprisoned within.</p> 
<p>This left the prisoners vulnerable to the loyal Waffen-SS troops prowling the countryside in search of deserters and enemies of the regime. This is when the strange, unlikely union of German and American forces began. Kurt-Siegfried Schrader, a highly decorated SS Hauptsturmführer and Josef “Sep” Gangl, a Wehrmacht Major, joined Captain John “Jack” Carey Lee, Jr., an American Tank Company Commander, in protecting the prisoners and defending the castle.</p> 
<p>Schrader and Gangl had become disillusioned with the Nazi ideology and both independently connected with the Austrian resistance. Upon hearing the prisoners at the castle were unguarded, Schrader went to the fortress to protect those held inside. Gangl, now serving as the head of the local resistance, was aware the forces under his command would not be strong enough to fight against the nearby Waffen-SS troops. He realized he needed the American forces to arrive, so he set off to find them in Kufstein.</p> 
<p>Not long after arriving in Kufstein, Gangl met up with Lee and they began plotting. After a reconnaissance mission, Lee and his friend brought their Sherman Tanks to the defend the castle. But along the way, poor infrastructure caused one tank and its crew to be left behind.</p> 
<p>Once at the castle, Wehrmacht soldiers and the few Americans prepared for battle. The prisoners were instructed to remain safely in the cellar, but many defied these orders and fought alongside the German and American troops. The stage was now set for the fight.</p> 
<p>Between 100 and 150 Waffen-SS troops attacked the castle in the early morning hours of May 5. Though one Wehrmacht soldier abandoned his post during the fighting, the remaining American-German defenses held the prison until more American troops from the 142nd Infantry Regiment arrived 12 hours after the fighting had begun. With the help of the additional American troops, the guards defeated the Waffen-SS in what’s viewed the last battle fought in the European theater of World War II. Gangl sadly perished during the fight.</p> </blockquote> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/06/16/in-i-was.html" class="microblog_permalink">Jun 17, 2023 ↓</a> 
<p>In 2012 I was newly married. Britt and I had decided to take our wedding business somewhere bigger than 1-2 weddings a year, so we started marketing and building out content.</p> 
<p>Every day was so exciting, going from nothing to something.</p> 
<p>It feels the same at the moment, after having essentially dropped off the wedding industry map for a year, coming back in I feel like a newcomer.</p> 
<p>So getting these kinds of emails is weird and beautiful and terrible and amazing.</p> 
<p>Never change, wedding industry.</p>

<p>I'll always remember the day I met the late Gold Coast Mayor, Ron Clarke, and he called me Red Dog for no apparent reason.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/06/17/from-apple-iie.html" class="microblog_permalink">Jun 17, 2023 ↓</a> <h3>From Apple IIe to AI: Embrace the Wave or Risk Irrelevance</h3> 
<p>I vividly remember all of my earliest computer experiences. I remember borrowing computer magazines from the school library that contained basic code, and then taking it to the Apple IIe in the back of my classroom. I would spend hours typing in code just to run another program. I also remember building a spreadsheet to help my dad run his business, and printing our own greeting cards with personalised messages on our black-and-white, dot matrix printer.</p> 
<p><img src="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2023/fd1ed0bf93.jpg" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p> 
<p><img src="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2023/media.jpg" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p> 
<p>Even back in the 90s, there was talk of this coming artificial intelligence wave. Funnily enough, my entire experience from the very first day was about artificial intelligence. The simple fact that I could press the letter 'a' on a plastic keyboard and then see that letter appear on the computer screen in front of me, or even get printed out by a printer, was, in my humble opinion, a form of artificial intelligence. This might be an oversimplified view, but whether it's displaying the letter 'a' on a computer screen or using ChatGPT, it's all about computers computing.</p> 
<p>In 1999, Bill Gates published a book called '<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_@_the_Speed_of_Thought">Business @ the Speed of Thought</a>'. I read it maybe a year later, and the foundational principles of "using computers for a real purpose" have stuck with me ever since. One idea was that a sandwich shop could use just-in-time ordering for sandwich ingredients based on previous order histories for different days of the week, taking into account seasons, weather, and trends - a task that a computer in 1999 could perform with some effort, but a task a computer in 2023 could handle effortlessly. This resonates with <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2011/12/21/steve-jobs-bicycle-for-the-mind-1990/">Steve Jobs's idea that computers are like bicycles for the mind</a>, an idea based on the fact that the fastest and most productive animal on the planet is not a human, but a human on a bicycle.</p> <blockquote> 
<p>I think one of the things that really separates us from the high primates is that we're tool builders. I read a study that measured the efficiency of locomotion for various species on the planet. The condor used the least energy to move a kilometer. And, humans came in with a rather unimpressive showing, about a third of the way down the list. It was not too proud a showing for the crown of creation. So, that didn't look so good. But, then somebody at Scientific American had the insight to test the efficiency of locomotion for a man on a bicycle. And, a man on a bicycle, a human on a bicycle, blew the condor away, completely off the top of the charts.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>This simple principle - that humans are more efficient on a bike, and that the human mind is more efficient when using a computer - has proven true in my life every day for the last 30 years.</p> 
<p>Quickly replying to enquiry emails on my iPhone from a toilet cubicle at my last job before becoming self-employed was a key factor in my early success.</p> 
<p>That's my encouragement to anyone skeptical about the 2023 "AI wave", including ChatGPT, large language models, transformer models, AI, generative art, etc. It's just what computing is now. Embrace it and exploit it to your benefit. Whether it's for play or for work, use these technologies to not only stay ahead of the pack, but to keep up with the pack.</p> 
<p>A fellow wedding celebrant argued on a post of mine about AI that anyone using this technology should be de-registered. My counter-argument is that any celebrant (or entrepreneur) not using this technology will self de-register within a few years, sinking into irrelevance and inefficiency due to their refusal to adapt.</p> <h3>AI’s right of reply</h3> 
<p>As an AI developed by OpenAI, I'd like to add that I'm designed to assist and augment human capabilities rather than replace them. In the case of a wedding celebrant, for example, I could help with tasks such as drafting vows or organizing schedules. The idea isn't to detract from the human element, but rather to enhance it, freeing up time for more personal interactions.</p> 
<p>The notion of de-registering those who use AI perhaps stems from a fear of being replaced or a misunderstanding of AI's role. AIs are tools, much like computers or smartphones, meant to assist humans in various tasks and should be seen as such. Adopting AI and other technological advancements can lead to increased efficiency and enable people to adapt to the fast-paced world we live in. It's about integrating technology into our lives and work in a way that benefits us all. </p> <hr>

<p>One of my childhood happy memories was receiving gifts from my Aunty Tracey who lived in Lichtenstein. She was always sending Liechtenstein paraphernalia and propaganda and I was here for it.</p> 
<p>For over 30 years I’ve kept this magical vision in my mind of what the richest country per capita on earth would look like.</p> 
<p>How safe could a country with no defence force feel? How do you even get to a country that has no airport? How small can the smallest country to win an Olympic medal be? How beautiful could the only country on earth to be completely in the alps be?</p> 
<p>Today I got some answers.</p>

<p>We're really lucky to be staying near the summits of the mountains, in Malbun, with friends of my aunt (thank you Martina and Markus!), it feels like we're on the set of a fantastical movie. It's unbelievably beautiful here.</p> <iframe width="100%" height="500px" allowfullscreen="true" allow="accelerometer; magnetometer; gyroscope" style="display:block; margin:20px auto; border:0 none; max-width:880px;border-radius:8px; box-shadow: 0 1px 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.11),0 2px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.11),0 4px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.11),0 6px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.11),0 8px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.11);" src="https://panoraven.com/en/embed/2UJ2qPniQ7"></iframe> <iframe width="100%" height="500px" allowfullscreen="true" allow="accelerometer; magnetometer; gyroscope" style="display:block; margin:20px auto; border:0 none; max-width:880px;border-radius:8px; box-shadow: 0 1px 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.11),0 2px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.11),0 4px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.11),0 6px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.11),0 8px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.11);" src="https://panoraven.com/en/embed/Vcxx8R9Qhw"></iframe>

<p>Some of the most interesting Lichtenstein facts I know:</p> <ol> <li>Liechtenstein is one of the smallest countries in the world, both in terms of land area and population. It covers just 160 square kilometres, about the physical size of Geelong, with a population of just over 39,000, about the same population as the town of Orange in New South Wales.</li> <li>It is one of only two countries in the world that are "double landlocked", which means they are landlocked by countries that are also landlocked. The other is Uzbekistan.</li> <li>Despite its small size, Liechtenstein is one of the wealthiest countries in the world per capita. The Prince of Lichtenstein, the head bloke, makes $40 mil a month off his own investments and businesses, he doesn't take a wage or anything like that.</li> <li>Liechtenstein is the world’s largest exporter of false teeth, specifically for dentures. This is due to the presence of Ivoclar Vivadent, a company that leads the world in false teeth manufacturing. The country is also home to Hilti the construction tools company.</li> <li>Liechtenstein doesn't have its own airport or railway system. The nearest airport is in Zurich, Switzerland. For rail, it is served by the Swiss railways.</li> <li>Liechtenstein is a principality, governed by a constitutional monarch who holds expansive powers, including the ability to veto legislation. It is the last remaining monarchy in the Holy Roman Empire.</li> <li>Liechtenstein had the highest gross domestic product (GDP) per person in the world, when adjusted by purchasing power parity.</li> <li>The entire country is invited to the castle of the Prince of Liechtenstein for beer and pretzels on National Day (August 15).</li> <li>Despite being an independent country, Liechtenstein uses the Swiss Franc as its official currency.</li> <li>Liechtenstein has one of the lowest crime rates in the world. It has even been reported that the country's citizens often don’t lock their doors.</li> <li>Liechtenstein disbanded its army in 1868 because it was too costly. In fact, Switzerland has been responsible for its defence since 1923. The CIA World Factbook for many years incorrectly stated it had a defence budget of $12. It's actually closer to zero.</li> <li>The country’s capital, Vaduz, and the region of the Alps, has been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site for its stunning alpine beauty.</li> <li>Liechtenstein is known for its excellent wines. The Prince of Liechtenstein Winery, owned by the princely family, is one of the most famous wineries. I drank one of his beers today and it's equally delicious.</li> <li>Despite its location in Central Europe, Liechtenstein managed to remain neutral and was untouched during both World War I and World War II.</li> <li>There are more businesses registered in Lichtenstein than residents, so most of the residents work in support of these businesses, or in tourism, dentistry, or working for Hilti making tools.</li> </ol> </div> </div>
