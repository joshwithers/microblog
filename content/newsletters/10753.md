<p>I'm a Remarkable tablet user and was excited to see what they launched today but I'm out of the live stream already. Colour e-ink and a bigger screen aren't on my list of desired changes.</p> 
<p>Better, much better, Remarkably better, software is needed.</p> 
<p>Anyway, how cute is it watching every tech founder today wanna be Steve Jobs.</p>

<p><img src="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2024/8f7951b507.jpg" alt="Deleting the Overcast iOS app from my iPhone" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p> 
<p>I lost a friend in software today as I delete Overcast from my iPhone. A ten year relationship ended because life’s too short to use annoying apps.</p> <hr> 
<p>For software that I’ll often use a lot, on most days, the developer changed so many fundamental ways the app worked that it went from an app I loved dearly for a decade to the most annoying thing on my phone.</p> 
<p>Enacting sleep mode, something I'd do as I drearily fall asleep in a hotel room away from my family had been buried away.</p> 
<p>Streaming, something I didn't realise I used that much, because really annoying. Streaming barely worked before the upgrade - if I was sent an Overcast episode listen link from a friend it would almost never play on first try - but then to lose the feature was really annoying.</p> 
<p>It became an exercise in re-learning how to walk, but I'd never had an accident, I was just subjected to an updated and poorer experience.</p> 
<p>Plus iOS 18’s beta cycle hasn’t been kind to Overcast either, which is totally my cross to carry, but it’s still impacted the upgraded use experience.</p> 
<p>So I had to decide whether the Overcast audio engine was worth staying for, and decided I could live without. (Tim Apple: please feel free to buy Overcast and integrate the audio engine into Apple Podcasts.)</p> 
<p>So little did I know that Apple Podcasts has actually gotten a lot better recently.</p> 
<p>The podcast transcription is a feature I really like, and anyone I share podcast links with and from uses Apple Podcasts so shareability of podcasts is so much easier as is clicking links from podcast websites.</p> 
<p>Every podcast website has an Apple Podcasts link, none have an Overcast link.</p> <hr> 
<p>Before the Overcast update it was a fringe decision to be on a third party podcast app. After the update it was a liability.</p> 
<p>Life's too short to be confusedly thumbing through podcast apps trying to figure it all out again.</p> <hr> 
<p>Why blog about it? Because I can’t review about it.</p>

<p><a href="https://subtledigressions.substack.com/p/hallelujah-leonard-cohen-and-a-pulitzer">Hallelujah, Leonard Cohen, and a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer's suicide, by Yashvardhan Jain</a>:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>It took Cohen over four years to write Hallelujah. It was a process filled with agony, writing over eighty verses, stuck in a cycle of writing and discarding. In one of the interviews Cohen gave later in his life, he talks about this torment.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>And this which always encourages me in creating my own art:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>And Hallelujah, the first song on the LP’s second side, went unnoticed. Nobody cared. It seemed Hallelujah was fated for a quick extinction and would disappear into the void like most music, like a ‘broken Hallelujah’.</p> </blockquote> <iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y8AWFf7EAc4?si=hqVd68T-Kc8pUmjE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2024/09/08/i-try-to.html" class="microblog_permalink">Sep 8, 2024 ↓</a>

<p>Look, I might not be your favourite person, but at least I've never tried to sell you a MLM, or a course that promises you that you can make lots of money without any effort.</p> </div> </div>
