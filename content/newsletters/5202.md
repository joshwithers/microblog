<p>Driving from Siena, Italy, to Graz, Austria, today Goldie and I were looking for somewhere to stop for lunch and we decided on this place named after a beach in Los Angeles.</p> 
<p>I took Britt’s Fuji X-S10 with the 27mm f/2.8 for a play while we were there.</p>

<p>Over the weekend I wrote <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/08/06/commercial-radio-isnt.html">a piece about the fluff coming out of commercial radio in Australia</a>, referencing my own time in a commercial radio station in very remote Western Australia, and considering going back last year but the wage had actually decreased.</p> 
<p>Anyway, it was poorly written, so sitting at Gate F6 in Vienna Airport just now I edited and fixed it.</p> 
<p>Any other errors or omissions are the faulty of your web browser.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/08/08/pro-tip-for.html" class="microblog_permalink">Aug 8, 2023 ↓</a> 
<p>Pro tip for flying out of Vienna Airport: you walk past a Starbucks before check-in, and you think, “awesome, a not-Austrian coffee! If there’s Starbucks at check-in there’ll be a Starbucks after security,” but there isn’t.</p> 
<p>There is an epic kids playground though.</p>

<p>Why do airlines communicate a flight's departure time instead of a "be at the gate" time? Every airport and every airline has different timings and many of us live in flight anxiety because of the lack of information.</p> 
<p>Is there a good technical reason why departure time is communicated but not gate-deadline time?</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/08/08/after-two-months.html" class="microblog_permalink">Aug 9, 2023 ↓</a> 
<p>After two months in London, across regional Austria, Liechtenstein, regional Italy, Puglia, and Tuscany, it is so refreshing for my soul to be walking the streets of Paris again tonight.</p> 
<p>I could walk the streets of Paris and New York City for the rest of my days and never get bored or lose inspiration.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/10/pak-n-save-savey-meal-bot-ai-app-malfunction-recipes">Tess McClure in The Guardian</a> reports on Pak 'n' Save's mealbot:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>A New Zealand supermarket experimenting with using AI to generate meal plans has seen its app produce some unusual dishes – recommending customers recipes for deadly chlorine gas, “poison bread sandwiches” and mosquito-repellent roast potatoes.</p> 
<p>The app, created by supermarket chain Pak ‘n’ Save, was advertised as a way for customers to creatively use up leftovers during the cost of living crisis. It asks users to enter in various ingredients in their homes, and auto-generates a meal plan or recipe, along with cheery commentary. It initially drew attention on social media for some unappealing recipes, including an “oreo vegetable stir-fry”.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>We're in the beautiful age of quality assurance in large language models. The giveaway is that the supermarket responds with:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>(we are) disappointed to see “a small minority have tried to use the tool inappropriately and not for its intended purpose</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Instead of owning the issue and revealing that the whole thing is built on a house of cards and we're all just figuring this crap out.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/08/10/colonel-sanders-and.html" class="microblog_permalink">Aug 10, 2023 ↓</a> <h3>Colonel Sanders and the sadness in scaling businesses</h3> 
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1976/09/09/archives/for-the-colonel-it-was-fingerlickin-bad.html">Mimi Sheraton in the New York Times in 1976</a> telling the story of walking into a KFC with Colonel Harland Sanders:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>You're frying for 12 minutes—that's six minutes too long. What's more, your frying fat should have been changed a week ago. That's the worst fried chicken I've ever seen. Let me see your mashed potatoes with gravy, and how do you make them?</p> </blockquote> 
<p>The Colonel is paid $200,000 a year to do advertising and PR for KFC, but when asked about Sanders' remarks on the chain's methods post-sale:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>Raw chicken turns customers off, so we play it safe and fry at lower temperatures for a longer time than the colonel likes.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Which is fair, but this plays to my theory on scaling businesses.</p> 
<p>When you run a small or micro business, a single storefront, or perhaps a business like Britt and I do with <a href="https://withers.co/elopementcollective">The Elopement Collective</a>, or our <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/664131985860711112?source_impression_id=p3_1691652644_ReS5ilVa35tdg7qv">Airbnb</a>, or my <a href="https://withers.co/celebrant">celebrancy practice</a>. Businesses that are anti-scale can celebrate the JOMO of business, the joy of missing out. We can't do every elopement, or every wedding, or take every Airbnb booking on the Gold Coast.</p> 
<p>Because of our very deliberate JOMO we can chose a different direction for our businesses where we aim to be five our of five stars, or whatever rating system is in play, we just aim to be the best.</p> 
<p><a href="https://cabel.com/about/">Cabel</a> Sasser once <a href="https://twitter.com/cabel/status/1195045257835999232">tweeted</a>:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>I can’t help but feel there’s a wonderful and often unexplored middle ground between “die” and “grow and grow aggressively”</p> </blockquote> 
<p>And ever since I read that I've been fascinated on that <em>unexplored middle ground</em>.</p> 
<p>When you decide to scale you very simply decide not to be the best, but instead to be the biggest, the cheapest, the most-available, and you turn your back on the best.</p> 
<p>I remember a small hotel we stayed at in Manhattan once and it proudly boasted a 7.2 rating on one of the hotel review websites which rated hotels out of 10.</p> 
<p>If one of our businesses was 72% as good as the best of that category of businesses we'd shut it down, or completely rework it until it was a really good business and bringing immense value to people.</p> 
<p>But when you're just one of the thousands of hotels in New York, maybe 7.2 is ok?</p> 
<p>But it's not ok for me and it wasn't ok for the Colonel.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/08/10/sari-azouts-letter.html" class="microblog_permalink">Aug 10, 2023 ↓</a> 
<p>Sari Azout's "<a href="https://sublimeinternet.substack.com/p/letter-to-a-friend-who-is-thinking">letter to a friend who is thinking of starting something new</a>" is beautiful. As Sari subtitles it, 'if you are thinking of leaving your job to start a company or passion project, this letter is for you too.'</p> <blockquote> <ol> <li>Will you use this opportunity to grow and evolve or will you use it to beat yourself up?<br> </li> <li>How will you avoid insecurity work?</li> <li>Can you learn to enjoy the process as the end in itself, not the means?</li> <li>Can you learn to enjoy the process as the end in itself, not the means?</li> <li>Will you default to the norms of your industry, or will you be an original?</li> <li>What tools will you use to quiet your ego and see reality clearly?</li> <li>Do you have clarity on what kind of financial value you aim to create?</li> </ol> </blockquote> 
<p>If I had a beef to pick with anyone in the world today it's how so many of us let life happen to us instead of us making us happen to life.</p> <blockquote> 
<p>I hope you get to know your inner world. I hope you thrive financially while living your values. I hope you focus less on what you achieve and more on who you become. I hope you learn to be kind to yourself. I hope you fall in love with the process. I hope you see the point of pursuing passion work is not to drain yourself to create work that eclipses your life, but rather to create a life you are proud of. I hope this new venture takes you far away from conformism and enables you to make a life and a living on your own terms, with your spirit and creativity unhindered.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>With any luck you're reading this article well after I first shared it in August 2023, and if this is the case I felt the need to find the link and send it to you as you consider embarking on something new.</p> 
<p>Make this process mean something so we have a cool story to talk about in a decade's time.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/08/10/an-element-of.html" class="microblog_permalink">Aug 10, 2023 ↓</a> 
<p>An element of the wedding industry which offends so many inside and out, the part that eventually pushes many insiders out and back into the normal world where couples kissing in front of you all day at work is not normal, is the unreal nature of so many weddings. That for a single day people dress up and play pretend.</p> 
<p>I can tell you that although I've witnessed it over my fifteen years in the business, I also push back against it at every chance. I'm also lucky that my clientele aren't indicative of that side of the wedding industry.</p> 
<p>Which is why I love film photography. It's so raw and honest. Often imperfect, and perhaps with error, it's a plain and simple recording of the light that entered the lens at that time.</p> 
<p>So here's some film photos made by my friend <a href="https://houseofloveweddings.com">James</a> at the two Italian elopements we had together last week in Tuscany.</p>

<p>Another chapter in the ever-growing story of how I interact with, and use, social media:</p> 
<p>I wrote a little while ago about choosing two social networks.</p> 
<p>I kind of have, Mastodon and Threads/Instagram/Facebook. By which I mean that the Meta platforms all blur together with crossposting and attention.</p> 
<p><img src="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2023/publish-ai-content-to-remaining-social-platformsv15.png" width="600" height="371" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p> 
<p>That leaves my remaining accounts from the <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/07/06/social-media-tier.html">tier list</a>, Facebook Page, LinkedIn, and Twitter/X.</p> 
<p>Rather than delete them, like I'd rather, I've trialled throwing them to ChatGPT.</p> 
<p>I'm still refining the prompt, but here's what I'm asking ChatGPT 4 to do in a Zapier <a href="https://zapier.com/shared/77a57ca94af5b4ed3dce6108315eb37f001d87a5">zap</a>:</p> 
<p>It starts with an instruction, or a set up which looks like this ...</p> <blockquote> 
<p>You are a content producer for Josh Withers the Australian wedding celebrant, a marriage celebrant famous worldwide for creating epic marriage ceremonies for adventurous people. You believe that the best kind of marriage ceremony and wedding is an intentional one, where everyone invited is invited for a reason and with a purpose, and that everything that happens at the wedding happens with intentionality and purpose. You are not necessarily against wedding traditions but you are against wedding traditions for the sake of wedding traditions. You write and speak in Australian English, and in a classic and timeless nature but with the wit and humour of Australian marriage celebrant Josh Withers. Be funny. When talking about weddings use inclusive language, use bride only if you're talking about a female person getting married, not as the title of the wedding industry client, and explore a diverse range of topics, cultures, and kinds of people that could get married.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Then I prompt it to write a post like this ...</p> <blockquote> 
<p>Write another new controversial tweet as Josh Withers, do not enclose it in quotation marks, written in the style of Australian wedding celebrant Josh Withers based off his writing online and on social media, asking a question or posing an thought about Josh Withers's wedding planning style. The tweet can be a controversial opinion about a modern, inclusive, intentional style of getting married; or an insight into modern wedding planning; or a reflection on wedding traditions of old and how they don't matter any more. Designed to illicit engagement and a response from people who see it. Take into account all interviews and responses by Josh Withers Australian wedding celebrant, and everything Josh has written on his online. Keep the message to under 280 characters. Do not start with greetings, do not use Australian slang like "G'day", do not use any hashtags. Be controversial and talk about all kinds of different wedding topics. Make each tweet different and unique.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>There's a 66% chance of the zap running that every hour, and 50% of the time the content goes to Facebook.</p> 
<p>My engagement on these existing platforms has been very low for a long time, so let's see if this moves the needle.

<p>I think I’ve spent too much time in Paris this year.</p> 
<p>I just got into an argument with another dad about which Parisian playground is the best one.</p> 
<p>The American fool thinks the Lourve playground is the best.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/08/13/we-have-hours.html" class="microblog_permalink">Aug 13, 2023 ↓</a> 
<p>We have 48 hours left in Paris. I'm I'm curious what your one awesome thing to do, see, eat, or photograph in Paris. We travel slow, don't travel like tourists, don't really hit the common "top 10 things to see" lists, and we're travelling with two kids, so sometimes we miss things that everyone thinks is awesome. Give me your one recommendation.</p> </div> </div>
