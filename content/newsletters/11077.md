<p>The story-song by the Crash Test Dummies, 'Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm', played this morning and I decided to - for the first time in my life - examine the song's lyrics.</p> 
<p>It's essentially the story of three children in not-ideal situations, but not neccesarily bad or negative situations. Not underwhelming or overwhelming. Just three kids in whelming situations.</p> 
<p>The first is the story of a boy whose hair is bleached as a result of a car accident. The second a girl with birthmarks on her body. The song then turns on a bridge when it's revealed that their stories aren't as bad as the third who has simply "always just gone" to a pentecostal church.</p> 
<p>In response Canadian singer Brad Roberts - with that iconic bass-baritone voice - sings 'Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.'</p> 
<p>Which I guess is his way of saying, "cool story bro."</p> 
<p>So now, from this day forward I intend to reply to all cool stories with an mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, and if anyone questions my reply I'll not acknowledge them with anything but an mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm if it feels appropriate.</p> 
<p>I'm just being my best reply guy self.</p>

<p>In case anyone was interested, it costs $1600 to fly Qantas then Jetstar from Hobart to the Gold Coast today if Virgin wasn’t able to rebook you on other flights today and yours was getting in to Sydney too late and you’d miss your connection. Just a lazy $1600 and there goes this week’s profit margin.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2024/09/27/a-frontpage-of.html" class="microblog_permalink">Sep 27, 2024 ↓</a> <h3>A front-page of the internet for the good burghers of the Apple nation</h3> 
<p>When I read about iMore closing yesterday an idea I'd been thinking about for a while came back to the front of my mind.</p> 
<p>My favourite sport to follow is Apple and adjacent tech. Living in Australia a lot of that reporting, opining, talk, and gossip happens while I'm asleep, so I'll like the idea of a "front page of the web" for my favourite sport.</p> 
<p>So I deployed a domain name I've held onto for 15 years to build <a href="https://theapplenation.com">theapplenation.com</a> yesterday. It's a testament to Wordpress and OpenAI that I can pull something like that together in an hour or so.</p> 
<p>The whole website is just one page, the front page, that shows you the last 36 hours of Apple related content from the web.</p> 
<p>If no-one else ever uses or visits the site I'll be happy to just use it myself, but I thought I'd share on the chance that there might be other burghers of the Apple nation that might be interested in saving it as a bookmark, or a homepage in their browser like I've done.</p> 
<p>For those who celebrate, the tech stack is wildly simple. Wordpress running the RSS Retriever plugin that summarises the article in ChatGPT and posts a referring link on the front page, then deletes it in 36 hours.</p> 
<p>The websites I'm sharing links to today include:</p> <ul> <li>404 Media</li> <li>512 Pixels</li> <li>9to5Mac</li> <li>Above Avalon</li> <li>Apple Developer</li> <li>Apple Newsroom</li> <li>Applelnsider</li> <li>Basic Apple Guy</li> <li>Cult of Mac</li> <li>Daring Fireball</li> <li>Hacker News (if the headline mentions Apple)</li> <li>MacSparky</li> <li>MacStories</li> <li>Mark Gurman on Bloomberg</li> <li>Michael Tsai’s blog</li> <li>On my Om</li> <li>Patently Apple</li> <li>Six Colors</li> <li>Spyglass</li> <li>Stratechery</li> <li>The Eclectic Light Company</li> <li>The Verge (their Apple feed)</li> <li>TidBITS</li> </ul> 
<p>No ads, no subscription, no tracking except for Tinyltics analytics so I know if it somehow gets wildly popular.</p> 
<p>Just something fun for a thing I find fun in</p> 
<p><img src="https://cdn.some.pics/withers/66f601da1e383.png" alt="Screenshot of theapplenation.com" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p> <h3>About the domain name</h3> 
<p>I’ve owned the domain name for about 15 years and here is its weird story.</p> 
<p>In 2009 Facebook introduced pages. Before this time businesses and non-human entities started profiles that people would add as "friends". When I saw the feature I tapped "create a page" and typed option+shift+k.</p> 
<p>Overnight hundreds of thousands of people became fans of .</p> 
<p>A few weeks into it Apple legal got in touch and said no way, so we renamed it to "Fans of Apple".</p> 
<p>Then a dude from CBS in LA gets in touch about monetising it and going big on the interwebs. He -and I - thought this Apple company might go somewhere and maybe it would be a good business opportunity. He was big on buzzwords like UGC and ROI. He suggested I register a domain name for the new project and community and he was busy getting funding from rich people. I was on breakfast radio in Esperance, Western Australia, so I waited patiently and decided upon theapplenation.com for the new brand.</p> 
<p>Then they stopped replying to emails and I’ve held onto the domain since then.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2024/09/30/im-predicting-the.html" class="microblog_permalink">Sep 30, 2024 ↓</a> <h3>I’m predicting the Apple foldable phone will have a hinge</h3> 
<p>I’ve been pondering what an Apple response to the foldable phones from Pixel/Google and Samsung might look like, and <a href="https://spyglass.org/pixel-fold-versus-iphone/">M.G. Siegler’s piece on Spyglass about the Pixel Fold</a> cemented it.</p> 
<p><img src="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2024/img-0703.jpeg" width="600" height="571" alt="Pixel Fold, from Spyglass by M.G. Siegler" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p> 
<p>I can’t imagine Apple releasing a plastic screen iPhone and compromising on screen quality considering the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-62727710.amp">long term degradation of the folding screen</a>.</p> 
<p><img src="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2024/img-0704.webp" width="600" height="400" alt="Microsoft Duo 2 from The Verge" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p> 
<p>Witnessing the iPhone become thinner each year, along with bezels and screen margins becoming smaller and smaller, I can imagine an Apple play on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23171638/microsoft-surface-duo-2-dual-screen-revisit-updates-price">Microsoft Duo 2</a>. A hinged device instead of a folding screen.</p> 
<p>It just seems smarter for durability, service, repair, and the hallowed "customer-sat".</p> </div> </div>
