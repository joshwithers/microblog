<p><strong>Why would you make new music when all the growth in the industry is from old music</strong></p> 
<p>At a wedding recently I heard my mate <a href="http://www.chrishutchisonweddings.com">Hutcho</a> belt out an old school banger with more energy and passion than the original artist could of. I jokingly asked afterward, "why do people make new music?" There is so much good music, how do you even get the guts to release a new song and meekly tell the world that you've made new music despite there being so much good music.</p> 
<p>Then once you actually make new music, you're hoping that the algorithmically-driven music industry today accepts your offering and feeds it to the masses, so much so that you can put food on the table.</p> 
<p>Then I read about the actual state of the music industry. <a href="https://tedgioia.substack.com/p/is-old-music-killing-new-music">Ted Gioia writes a few days ago</a>:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>"All the growth in the market is coming from old songs. The 200 most popular tracks now account for less than 5% of total streams."</p> </blockquote> 
<p>And if you enjoy reading about the death, and rebirth, of pop, you should read <a href="https://adamsinger.substack.com/p/pop-is-dead-and-no-one-cares">Adam Singer as well.</a>.</p>

<p>"CoreLogic’s Quarterly Auction Market Review shows 42,918 properties were taken to auction across the combined capital cities in the three months to Dec 2021, an 85.1% increase from the previous quarter and more than double (109.5%) the Dec 2020 figures."<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/01/24/this-is-nuts.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-01-24</a></p> </blockquote> <hr>

<p>A relationship is about inventing your own language, says Céline Sciamma:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>“You’ve got the jokes, you’ve got the songs, you have this anecdote that’s going to make you laugh three years later. It’s this language that you build. That’s what you mourn for when you’re losing someone you love. This language you’re not going to speak with anybody else.”<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/01/24/a-relationship-is.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-01-24</a></p> </blockquote> <hr>

<p><strong>"If you can live your life without an audience, you should do it"</strong></p> 
<p>I don't like a lot of what I see on Instagram Stories.</p> 
<p><a href="https://embedded.substack.com/p/im-a-better-friend-without-instagram?r=ilth&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web">Nick Catucci says the same in Embedded this week</a>:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>"Instagram Stories had been an IV drip of validation for the past five years, and giving myself permission to live my life not as a constant performance, but for myself, has been liberating. It also means I’m not viewing other peoples’ performances, either, which has brought another unexpected benefit: I’m a better friend."</p> </blockquote>

<p>Brian Koppelman:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>"To an artist, rejection, at first, feels like death. That’s how personal the work is. And that’s why we’re afraid to do the work. Because then we have to show it. And then they might reject it. But rejection is only a death if you let it stop you from doing the work the next day."<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/01/26/brian-koppelman-to.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-01-26</a></p> </blockquote> <hr>

<p>Why Agatha Christie could afford a maid and a nanny but not a car, <a href="https://fullstackeconomics.com/why-agatha-christie-could-afford-a-maid-and-a-nanny-but-not-a-car/">Timothy B Lee</a>:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>"It’s one of the most important economic mysteries of the modern world. While the material things in life are cheaper than ever, labor-intensive services are getting more and more expensive. Middle-class Americans today have little trouble affording a car, but they struggle to afford a spot in day care."</p> </blockquote>

<p>"When rain falls, it flows downhill. If desired, you can collect the rain in a bucket and carry it uphill, but the natural tendency of water is to flow toward the lowest point.</p> 
<p>Most situations in life have a tendency—a direction in which things want to flow. You can choose to go against the flow (just as you can choose to carry water uphill), but your results tend to be better when you find a way to work with the gradient of the situation.</p> 
<p>Position yourself to benefit from the external forces at hand and you will get more from the same unit of effort. Energy is conserved and results are multiplied."</p>
