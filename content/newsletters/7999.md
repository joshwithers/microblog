<p>I have no idea what I'm doing, I'm like a toddler flying an A380.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2024/03/27/as-march-almost.html" class="microblog_permalink">Mar 27, 2024 ↓</a> 
<p>As March 2024 almost comes to a close I’m reminded how it’s four years since my life fell apart.</p> 
<p>Four years on I’m seeing a therapists and building a new life in Tasmania, basically starting a-fresh, it’s like 2012 all over again, the 100% brand new kid on the block.</p> 
<p>Still tens thousands of dollars behind.</p> 
<p>Still mentally scarred quite bad.</p> 
<p>But I turned a corner recently. I was encouraged to understand that no-one from any government or any group is going to come and apologise and I need to forgive, and move on.</p> 
<p>I was so busy holding on for dear life that I never even realised that I was the one holding myself back. Covid wasn't my fault, but letting it dictate my mental wellbeing in March 2024 is, and it's never too late to see a therapist and to talk honestly with friends.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2024/04/01/the-frequent-vower.html" class="microblog_permalink">Apr 1, 2024 ↓</a> <h3>The Frequent Vower Card</h3>
