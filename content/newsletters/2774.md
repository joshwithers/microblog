<p>Nine years ago I had an internet-enabled egg tray. I feel like technology has not really advanced past this milestone.</p>

<p>How is Jetstar the only Australian airline fully utilising the Apple Wallet API with flight and gate updates and heaps of info inside the ticket info page?</p>

<p>Is flying with your pillow a thing? Half the passengers disembarking and about the same boarding my flight have pillows. It’s an 11am 90 minute flight!<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/12/14/is-flying-with.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-12-14</a></p> <hr>

<p>Chatted to a flight attendant today who is proudly quitting and taking a job with Virgin after Christmas because of all the "negativity at Jetstar" which is hard to believe because Jetstar seems like it would be the loveliest place to work if you hate existing.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/12/14/chatted-to-a.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-12-14</a></p> <hr> 
<p>iOS 16.2 means we can listen to music without the lyrics for focused work<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/12/14/ios-means-we.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-12-14</a></p> <hr> 
<p>My favourite thing about flying out of regional locations in Australia is that you can be having coffee with a mate just before the flight, watch the flight coming to land which, means you should probably get up and drive to the airport so you can walk on just-in-time.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/12/15/my-favourite-thing.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-12-15</a></p> <hr> 
<p>Before we get too excited about fusion energy, space travel and flying cars, it’s important to remember that this is how Australia Post wants me to find a lost package, with details from a Windows 2000 screenshot and calling a national hotline.</p>

<p>Growing up in Central Queensland meant your coastline was always filled with ships taking coal and sugar to the world.</p> 
<p>I really weirdly always feel alone when I look at a coastline and see no ships.</p> 
<p>So it’s been nice to be back in Mackay for a few hours.</p> <video controls="controls" playsinline="playsinline" src="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2022/dae4391f86.mov" width="360" height="640" poster="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2022/74d49efa8d.png" preload="none"></video>

<p>What a dramatic moment: Just dropped in to get a haircut from my favourite barber before I fly back to North America on Tuesday and he’s quitting his job as I walk in!
