<p>Was just driving and stopped at a red traffic light in a small Italian village and a civilian car drives up being me, looks around, and just overtakes me and runs the red light. I love Italy.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/06/26/apple-vision-has.html" class="microblog_permalink">Jun 27, 2023 ↓</a> <h3>Apple Vision has been 'in development' for 28 years</h3> 
<p>Tim Cook once said that "we are high on AR for the long run" and it's true, for 28 years Apple - and the rest of the tech industry - has been noodling around on augmented reality and virtual reality.</p> 
<p>Out of a purely personal interest, I started flipping through rumours about Apple and its "glasses" to see where the leakers got it right and wrong, and the next minute I'm back in 1995, so I thought a curated list of all the leaks, rumours, and related dates might be a nice record to make in the year of our headset, AVP 0.</p>

<p>Such a display would convincingly create the illusion of objects with arbitrary optical properties. A metallic object depicted using the display would reflect the visual surroundings of the display. Dielectric materials would show correct refraction and reflection effects. Light shone on the display would illuminate the virtual objects within it. When programmed to depict empty space, the display would, for all practical purposes, disappear, rendering the contained volume invisible. Incremental steps towards such a device are discussed.</p> </blockquote>

<p>The patent notes that visual-based inertial navigation systems can achieve positional awareness down to the centimetre scale without the need for GPS or cellular network signals. However, the technology is unsuitable for implementation in typical mobile devices because of the processing demands involved in variable real-time location tracking.</p> 
<p>To overcome the limitation, Apple's invention uses something called a sliding window inverse filter (SWF) that minimizes computational load by using predictive coding to map the orientation of objects relative to the device.</p> </blockquote>

<p>As a family we travel with a MacBook Pro, iPad mini, two iPhones, Apple Watch, and a series of things that require either USB-A, USB-C, or micro USB to charge. We’ve chosen gadgets and utilities that are all USB-C, with exceptions where necessary.</p> 
<p>My DJI Magic 3 drone batteries need 65W but my current travel charger’s 65W apparently doesn’t quite meet the needs the DJI three-battery USB-C charger, so the 96W Apple original MBP charger does the MacBook and the drone batteries.</p> 
<p>For a family of four travelling globally for a year it was hard to figure out the exact right kit, but we got there in the end.</p> 
<p>So my worldwide travel solution has been
- two Anker 543 Chargers (65W II), these have two USB-A ports, a USB-C 45W port and a USB-C 20W port
- my original 96W MacBook charger.</p> 
<p>Each of these, including the MacBook charger, takes as an input the figure 8 lead. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_60320">Figure 8 leads, or IEC C7</a> leads as they’re technically known, are very easy to procure locally, most Airbnb’s even have multiple devices already using them, they’re inexpensive, and they’re small to carry.</p> 
<p><img src="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2023/61ff7178fol.-ac-uf8941000-ql80-.jpeg" width="600" height="356" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p> 
<p>So I buy three IEC C7 leads for each region we’re travelling to. If we weren’t on a year long trip I’d hold onto the leads but suitcase space is at a premium. So far I’ve needed four different leads, a set for Australia, Mexico/USA, then the European kind, and finally the best of all - the British variety. The Brits don’t get much right but they figured out electrical points and plugs really well.</p> 
<p>I also have this assortment of cables
- 4x Thunderbolt 4/USB-C cables about 25cm long. These suit most charging, data, plugging-in situations.
- USB-C lightning leads for the iPhones 
- the Apple MagSafe travel dock for Watch and iPhone
- and the get out of jail free card is my USB-A to Lightning + USB-C + Micro-USB three-headed plug.</p> 
<p>That’s how we travel the globe keeping everything charged and no stress.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/06/29/the-number-one.html" class="microblog_permalink">Jun 29, 2023 ↓</a> 
<p>The number one indicator that you're an old dad is when your cables and leads company emails "Let's Catch Up!" and "We miss you!" as if you're high school buddies. </p>

<p>Is the future of TV, radio? Or the future of radio is TV? Either way, it's almost 7pm and this is what Italians are watching on TV?</p>

<p>For the past ten months, my and my family's non-clothing and non-toiletries life has completely lived inside a Think Tank camera bag and it will do so for another 50 days. I took the opportunity this afternoon to do a quick audit, headcount, and make sure everything I was carrying was necessary, and inspired by the <a href="https://hemisphericviews.com">Hemispheric Views podcast</a> segment 'Rate my desk' I thought I would submit my 'desk away from home' to the internets.</p> 
<p><img src="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2023/apc-0266.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p> 
<p>All of our life's possessions that aren't our actual home and the furniture in that home required for it to be on Airbnb, lives in our two <a href="https://july.com/au/luggage/checked-plus/">July 'Checked Plus'</a> bags, and two <a href="https://www.dagnedover.com/collections/the-landon-carryall#Onyx-ExtraLarge">Dagne Dover bags</a>, plus a <a href="https://au.philandteds.com/products/traveller-travel-cot">Phil &amp; Teds travel cot</a> and a <a href="https://babyjoggerstrollers.com.au/products/city-tour-2">Baby Jogger travel pram</a>, and this <a href="https://www.thinktankphoto.com/products/streetwalker-rolling-backpack-v2">Think Tank Streetwalker camera bag</a> pictured below.</p>

<p>The reason for the Think Tank Streetwalker bag is that it's unique in being a carry bag, a backpack, and a roller bag. It's the Optimus Prime of camera bags.</p> 
<p>I'll guess a few of the questions "What is that?!":</p> <ul> <li>Panic Playdate</li> <li>photocopies of passports and actual passports</li> <li>parfum</li> <li>new and identical backup sunglasses because the last place you want to be is in a strange new land without your favourite sunglasses</li> <li>octopus straps, you never know when you'll need to strap something to something (same goes for the tape)</li> <li>USB-C dock with an ethernet port, because sometimes you just need to plug the damn thing in to get internet</li> <li>my eldest daughter's camera (Nikon Coolpix childproof <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ79NMpqpJs">potato camera</a>)</li> <li>my wife's camera (Fuji X-S10 with a 27mm)</li> <li>my splurge camera purchase in Paris (Leica Z2X which means 2x zoom, film camera)</li> <li>my flying camera (DJI Mavic 3)</li> <li>my camera (Canon EOS R5)</li> <li><a href="https://www.nativeunion.com/products/belt-cable-universal">Native Union universal cable</a></li> <li>supporters gift from the <a href="https://weddinghangover.com">Wedding Photo Hangover podcast</a> </li> <li>DJI Mic kit</li> <li>MacBook Pro M2, a new addition to the kit after my former M1 MacBook Pro got drunk on a glass of whisky</li> <li>Philips OneBlade shaver, the best travel shaver I could find and the only one that has USB charging</li> <li> <a href="https://thrunite.com/archer-2a-v3-black-nw/">ThruNite torch that takes AA batteries</a> because you can't leave emergency eyesight to a lithium USB-charged battery</li> <li>35mm f/1.8, 50mm f/1.8, 70-200mm f/2.8</li> <li> <a href="https://www.anker.com/products/a2046?variant=42448630612118&amp;ref=collectionBuy">Anker charger</a> and Britt has one too</li> <li>my friend <a href="https://scottymcdonald.com">Scotty's latest book</a> on my Kobo Libra 2 (I'm a recent convert away from Kindle, and love this Kobo!)</li> </ul> 
<p>Our whole charging strategy is based on IEC C7 (Figure 8) leads and getting local leads wherever we go and they plug into the Anker chargers and the 96W Apple charger. There's <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/06/28/my-imho-aweome.html">a blog post</a> on my reasoning for this. I'm now a <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/06/29/the-number-one.html">cable dad</a>.</p>

<p>So, <a href="https://me.dm/@JoshuaWithers/110633369872612960">rate my desk</a>.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/06/30/temple-of-valadier.html" class="microblog_permalink">Jul 1, 2023 ↓</a> <h3>Temple of Valadier: Refuge for sinners</h3> 
<p>Over 1000 years old, this sanctuary in Genga's Frasassi Caves was intended to be a refuge from sinners, but when you see it from a sky, it looks like the church itself is seeking refuge from the world.</p> 
<p>The temple you now see was complete in 1827 under the suggestion of Pope Leo XII. For all this time it was called the Temple of Valadier but recent study has revealed that Giuseppe Valadier, its namesake architect, didn't design it at all.</p> 
<p>Either which way, it's nice to know that Catholic sinners get a cool place to pilgrimage to.</p> 
<p>I caught a few moments after the sun set, in between rain clouds, to get the drone up. I'd been driving for 45 minutes and gotten stuck down two dead ends.

<p>Looking for fiction book recommendations. Give me the name and why you think I'll like it.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/07/02/my-new-kobo.html" class="microblog_permalink">Jul 3, 2023 ↓</a> <h3>My new Kobo is better than my old Kindle, but barely</h3> 
<p>📚 I've owned and used a Kindle for over a decade, it had been my favourite gadget for so long. But over the years I started to realise that Amazon wasn't interested in pushing the platform forward any further and the software wasn't going to get any better. I even upgraded to the Amazon Kindle Scribe and it was an embarrassingly bad product. The final straw was when Jean-Louis Gassée's new book, <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9798987047446">Grateful Geek</a> just didn't work on any physical Kindle devices, despite Amazon happily selling me a copy.</p> 
<p>On the <a href="https://atp.fm">ATP</a> Marco Arment started expressing similar concerns a few weeks/months earlier in 2023 and he did the hard testing and returning work required to convince me to buy a Kobo Libra 2 while I was in Paris in May.</p> 
<p>I love this device, it's my new favourite gadget. But ...</p> <ul> <li>The Kobo store is in a dismal state, and/or, the publishing world is in a dismal state</li> <li>The eBook publishing world is run by terrible humans who sometimes charge more for an eBook than a printed book, often release the print book weeks or months before an ebook, and just generally don't know how to sell a book to people.</li> <li>There isn't a competing ebook marketplace outside of Amazon and Kobo.</li> <li>And there's a chance that the other great feature of Kobo eReaders is going away in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23778208/kobo-pocket-ebook-reader-integration-ending">Pocket integration</a>, that is, unless Kobo updates its software.</li> </ul> 
<p>So I'm now left in a weird spot, there are five books I'd like to read and buy, but I can't buy them for my Kobo. Will anyone sell me a plain old boring ePub?</p> <ul> <li> <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781635701883">MetaChurch</a> by Dave Adamson</li> <li> <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9798987047446">Grateful Geek</a> by Jean-Louis Gassée</li> <li> <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781101484197">Twilight Eyes</a> by Dean Koontz</li> <li> <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780307762733">The Elephant Vanishes</a> by Haruki Murakami</li> <li> <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781984881137">Paved Paradise</a> by Henry Grabar</li> </ul> 
<p>The <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/">enshitiffication</a> of the world continues and I guess those books will just sit on <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/bookshelf/">my electronic bookshelf</a> waiting for me to figure out how to read them without cutting down another tree or having two ereaders.</p>
