<p>I noticed a Jetstar Boeing 787-8 coming into Gold Coast Airport in some pretty strong winds and broke the camera out quickly.</p>

<p><strong>Expect streaming TV consolidation in the coming years</strong></p> 
<p>Matthew Belloni in <a href="https://puck.news/22-hollywood-predictions-for-2022-part-2/">Puck</a></p> <blockquote> 
<p>A good model is Peacock-WWE. Last March, NBC Universal took over the pro wrestling outfit’s WWE Network and its 1.1. million subs, offering them a deal on Peacock for their Roman Reigns fix. Check out these internal Peacock stats that came to me from a source:</p> <ul> <li>Of the 1.1 million subscribers to WWE Network, one million successfully converted to Peacock subscribers.<br> </li> <li>More than 3 million Peacock subs have watched WWE content since it moved over in March.</li> <li>More than half of those 3 million subs indicated that they signed up “because of WWE.”</li> </ul> 
<p>Rights and branding issues are thorny, but consolidation makes sense, even if it’s not a major merger like Comcast or Netflix or Roku picking off Lionsgate/Starz, or some of the other buzzed-about potential deals.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>I wonder what Australian consolidation we could see?</p> 
<p>There's no way that Youtube, Amazon, Netflix, Disney, or Apple will cede their position or brand, and maybe they could suck some streaming providers in. Viacom CBS seems set on playing the long game so they could be in the same lineup as the big five.</p> 
<p>That leaves SBS, ABC, Seven, Nine, Telstra, Stan, Kayo, Binge, Foxtel, Hayu, Optus Sport in the Australian market wanting credentials or money, and HBO Max, Hulu, Peacock, Fubo/ESPN not in the market ... yet?</p> 
<p>Who's left in 2025? Is there room for 20 subscriptions? Potentially $200 a month on TV.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/01/03/expect-streaming-tv.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-01-03</a></p> <hr>

<p><strong>Understand the rules so you can break them</strong></p> 
<p>One of the wisest things I was ever taught about radio broadcasting ... and life ... was that you needed learn the rules so you understood them so you could break them.</p> 
<p>Learning that rules were so you could understand not so you could be be limited, broke my mind and made me, me.</p> 
<p>I feel like <a href="https://seths.blog/2021/12/recipes-2/">Seth Godin</a> was on a similar vibe in this post:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>One sort of job requires people to follow a recipe. Another, better sort of job requires people to understand the recipe. If you understand it, that means you can change it. You have resilience and insight and the leverage to make it better.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/01/04/understand-the-rules.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-01-04</a></p> </blockquote> <hr> 
<p><a href="https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2021/11/10/making-friends-adults">Peter O'Dowd and Kalyani Saxena</a>:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>"When you were a kid, it seemed like you could walk up to just about anybody and be best friends the next minute. But somewhere along the long, winding road to adulthood, making new friends became an impossibly hard thing to do."<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/01/04/peter-odowd-and.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-01-04</a></p> </blockquote> <hr> 
<p>In Praise of Conspiracy Theories, <a href="https://ckarchive.com/b/zlughnhz932k">David Perell</a>:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>It’s easy to hate on conspiracy theories, but what are the best arguments for taking them seriously?</p> 
<p>Here's one: At a recent dinner, we started talking about John F. Kennedy assassination theories. One guy remarked that historical conspiracy theories are worth studying because they illuminate so much about the culture of the time.</p> 
<p>Studying the JFK conspiracy theories is a fun way to learn about the tension between Cuba and America, America’s rivalry with the KGB, the won’t-stop-at-anything political motivations of Lyndon B. Johnson, the mafia’s influence, and the power of America’s Central Intelligence Agency.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/01/04/in-praise-of.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-01-04</a></p> </blockquote> <hr> 
<p>I've got an old friend and we share ideas with each other. Then years later we share a news article about how someone "stole" our idea.</p> 
<p>James Clear's distinction between our sharing ideas and working on them, stings:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>"If you're not working hard, ideas don’t matter. The best idea is worthless without execution. If you're already working hard, ideas are crucial. Most effort is wasted on mediocre ideas."</p> </blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.theredhandfiles.com/fear-losing-old-fans/">Nick Cave on Kanye</a>:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>Making art is a form of madness – we slip deep within our own singular vision and become lost to it.

<p>The most disappointing element of modern society is the insistence that all stories (including the news, and celebrity or sport stories) must be completed as soon as possible so we can establish tribal battle lines and figure out if our tribe is winning or losing.</p> 
<p>Most stories require hours, if not weeks, or years to bake in the story oven.</p> 
<p>It’s highly likely that the stories you’re reading or hearing are actually half-baked and require a lot more time in the oven.</p> 
<p>Reject half-baked stories. Reject the need for every story to have a tweet or post attached to it. Embrace slow stories where the storyteller has spent time researching, listening, asking, and they’re delivering a well baked story.</p>
