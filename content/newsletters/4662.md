<p>About three hours ago I was putting my daughter to bed and thought it would be cute to have ChatGPT write a fairytale about Luna and where we're staying this week, Liechtenstein.</p> 
<p>I thought it was a cute story and something others might enjoy.</p> 
<p>Three hours later I've had Midjourney make illustrations, assembled the book - very roughly - in the 'Kindle Kids Book Creator', and it's now submitted to the Amazon Kindle store.</p> 
<p>You can see the ChatGPT prompts <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/902065ad-1c78-4505-8df5-bb88f3c6bfeb">here</a> and download <a href="https://let.josh.show/The-Mountain-Princess">the .mobi file here</a>. When it's live on the Kindle store I believe <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=B0C8L6LPYP">this link</a> will get you there.</p> 
<p>Three hours from a good idea to a low-fi book being published.</p>

<p>From the University of Berkshire Hathaway by Daniel Pecaut, Corey Wrenn:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>Buffett also shared some of his classic bits of wisdom about growing wealth. Spend less than what you make. Know and stay within your circle of competence. The only businesses that matter are the ones you put your money in. Keep learning over time. Don’t lose. Insist on a margin of safety.</p> </blockquote> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/06/20/you-should-not.html" class="microblog_permalink">Jun 21, 2023 ↓</a>

<p>I have a confession to make.</p> 
<p>I didn't know "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps">The Alps</a>" were a thing. I thought people referred to "the alps" when they referred to alpine areas.</p> 
<p>This probably explains why I nerded out pretty hard when I got to the Alps and kept on typing the alps and all my computing devices would autocorrect to The Alps.</p> 
<p>Anyway, here's a 360 photo of a part of the Alps from Kufstein in Austria.</p> <iframe width="100%" height="500px" allowfullscreen="true" allow="accelerometer; magnetometer; gyroscope" style="display:block; margin:20px auto; border:0 none; max-width:880px;border-radius:8px; box-shadow: 0 1px 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.11),0 2px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.11),0 4px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.11),0 6px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.11),0 8px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.11);" src="https://panoraven.com/en/embed/F5VntrJxIs"><img src="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2023/cleanshot-2023-06-20-at-22.15.432x.jpg" width="600" height="372" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></iframe>

<p>Is there an AI tool around yet to help manage customer journeys? New client comes in, and the AI can take that journey on the pre-set rails we decide on in the business. Automation, but with intelligence?</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/06/23/im-back-baby.html" class="microblog_permalink">Jun 24, 2023 ↓</a> 
<p>I’m back baby!</p> 
<p>Listening to an investor on a podcast today reminded me of how and why I do what I do. He was talking about advice that he had been given regarding his investment portfolio, and the person giving the advice said how well does that pie chart of what you’ve invested in reflect or match your interests, talents, and skills? The advice being that you should invest in what you know, invest in what you are passionate about.</p> 
<p>So, after a solid sabbatical that has taken us through Mexico, the United States of America, and so much of Europe, I am proud to say that we’re coming back to Australia in August and I’m coming back to work as a celebrant.</p> 
<p>It’s been a wild couple of years where I didn’t know if I’d ever want to create weddings anymore, but it turns out I just needed a few months off and some quality time with my girls.</p> 
<p>I say all of that, to say this. There's a book, and a principle, called the proximity principle, and it's a simple principle. The idea is that the people that are around you, the people that are your community, are the people most likely to be able to help you.</p> 
<p>So there are two things I would love some help with. Number one, when we get home we have to buy some cars, and buying a car today is terrible. If you or someone you know is selling your car, let a brother know. Secondly, we're coming back to work and my calendar is wide open. So if you know someone getting married, anywhere in the world, let them know that your mate Josh is a pretty good celebrant.</p> 
<p>Normally I’d say I’m looking forward to catching up with you when I’m home for a beer, but it turns - and I’ve researched this extensively on myself during this sabbatical - that beers make me fat and bloated and sick.</p> 
<p>So instead I’m looking forward to an old-fashioned or red wine when I’m home.</p> 
<p>See you soon!</p>

<p>I just want to go on the record for being totally cool and not scared at all by the demonic kitten sound coming from the vineyard outside our Airbnb in Northern Italy. I am a big brave man and not scared by the feline calling out in the pitch black night.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/06/25/does-apple-vision.html" class="microblog_permalink">Jun 26, 2023 ↓</a> <h3>Does Apple Vision mean 360 content is finally going to have its moment?</h3> 
<p>I've been playing around with 360 content for over seven years ago now and I have a few questions about where Apple is going to take the format.</p> 
<p>If you make 360 content today, you spend a lot of time looking at content like this:</p> 
<p><img src="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2023/cleanshot-2023-06-25-at-22.55.192x.jpg" width="600" height="338" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p> 
<p>It's not as appealing as the embeds below.</p> 
<p>I've recorded my work <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km8SXtRWAsg">creating marriage ceremonies in 360 video</a>, and with my various DJI drones, I've been trying to create 360 still content as well.</p> 
<p>My question and thought for today is how will the new spatial computing frontier handle consumer stills and video in 360? Will Apple standardise the media, and let it be viewed in Preview or Quick Look?</p> 
<p>Will other devices be able to make content for the Apple Vision, will Apple Vision 3D or 360 content be viewable and enjoyed on other platforms?</p> 
<p>How should content creators prepare for this new content-style? Is this permission to buy new gear?!!? (Please let my wife know if so). </p> 
<p>I've been bullish on 360 for over seven years, I'm excited to see where it goes.</p> <iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/km8SXtRWAsg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
