<p><strong>Kindle Oasis or a Kindle Scribe - which will be my new normal?</strong></p> 
<p>My second Amazon Kindle is a Kindle I've owned since late 2016, my first generation Kindle Oasis. It's been a solid travel companion but after six years its battery barely lasts a day and I'm hot for something new. I've been waiting for a 2022/2023 release of a new Oasis and when the Scribe was released I started thinking this might not occur.</p> 
<p>So while I was in native Amazon territory where deliveries are quick and returns are easily done at Whole Foods, I thought I'd buy both - the latest Kindle Oasis and the new Kindle Scribe - and return the one I liked the least.</p>

<p><strong>My new favourite parable: "sleep late, catch a few fish"</strong></p> 
<p>Just discovered my favourite parable:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>A businessman is sitting on the beach of a small fishing village when he sees a fisherman approach the shore with his daily haul. Impressed by the quality of the fish, the businessman asks the fisherman how long it took him to bring in his catch.</p> 
<p>“Just a short while,” the fisherman replies.</p> 
<p>“Why don’t you stay out longer to catch more fish?” the businessman asks.</p> 
<p>“Because this is all I need.”</p> 
<p>“But then what do you do with your time?”</p> 
<p>“I sleep late, catch a few fish, play with my kids, take a nap with my wife, and then join my buddies in town to drink wine and play guitar,” the fisherman responds.</p> 
<p>The businessman is shocked. He explains that he has an MBA, and that if the fisherman follows his advice, he could help him grow his business. “You could buy a bigger boat,” the businessman says, “and use the proceeds to open your own cannery.”</p> 
<p>“Then what?” the fisherman asks.</p> 
<p>“You could move to the city to open a distribution center.”</p> 
<p>“And then what?”</p> 
<p>“You could expand your business internationally and eventually take your company public,” the businessman says. “When the time is right, you could sell your shares and become very rich.”</p> 
<p>“And then what?”</p> 
<p>“Well, then you can retire, move to a small fishing village, sleep late, catch a few fish, play with your kids, take naps with your wife, and join your buddies in town to drink wine and play guitar.”</p> 
<p>The fisherman smiles at the businessman and continues down the beach.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/01/03/my-new-favourite.html" class="microblog_permalink">2023-01-04</a></p> </blockquote> <hr>

<p>Dear the United States of America,</p> 
<p>I would like to submit my application to become your house's Speaker. I'm of the understanding than you do not currently have a speaker, and you are in need of a speaker. It just so happens that speaking is one of the few things on this planet that I am really good at.</p> 
<p>Attached is photographic evidence of me at to Kirsten and Todd's wedding speaking quite well, you will notice them as much as I speak really good, I also slide into the background of the story if the photographer uses the correct aperture.</p> 
<p>For references, please see my Google and Facebook page reviews, where I maintain an almost five star rating, with the exception of a few random spam accounts that have left me one star reviews without any reason.</p> 
<p>It is possible that me being an Australian currently residing in Mexico may be an issue, but for the next week, I am still in Tennessee. If you are willing to give me a green card, I am willing to speak at your house.</p> 
<p>I am also available for weddings, parties, anything. </p> 
<p>Yours sincerely, the next speaker of the United States of America, Josh "Married By Josh" Withers.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Jobs: The thinker and the doer</strong></p> 
<p>Steve Jobs in 1990:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>"My observation is that the doers are the major thinkers. The people that really create the things that change this industry are both the thinker and doer in one person. And if we really go back and we examine, you know, did Leonardo have a guy off to the side that was thinking five years out in the future what he would paint or the technology he would use to paint it? Of course not. Leonardo was the artist, but he also mixed all his own paints. He also was a fairly good chemist. He knew about pigments, knew about human anatomy. And combining all of those skills together, the art and the science, the thinking and the doing, was what resulted in the exceptional result. And there is no difference in our industry. The people that have really made the contributions have been the thinkers and the doers."<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/01/06/steve-jobs-the.html" class="microblog_permalink">2023-01-06</a></p> </blockquote> <hr>

<p><strong>I chose a Kindle Scribe</strong></p> 
<p><a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/01/03/kindle-oasis-or.html">A few days ago I</a> ordered a latest generation Kindle Oasis and a new Kindle Scribe with the intention of only keeping one to replace my six year old Kindle Oasis who’s battery barely lasted a day.</p> 
<p>Today a UPS driver picks one up to take it back home to Bezos, and I’m keeping the Kindle Scribe.</p> 
<p>Why?</p> 
<p>Kindle Scribe Pros:
- Nice and big
- USB-C charging
- notepad and pencil input for note taking and signing paperwork
- so big
- all the Remarkable 2 you want with the benefit of all the Kindle you want
- new fancy product</p> 
<p>Kindle Scribe Cons:
- so very big
- no buttons
- too big
- a little heavy
- Kindle OS is still crappy and salesy
- new product, 1.0 version sadness </p>

<p>When you elope in a far-away destination you’re choosing a very different vibe and moment than a domestic elopement. It firmly places your ceremony - the beginning of your marriage - in the middle of an adventure. Between customs, packing, flights, delays, transfers, language barriers, different foods and weather, it’s impossible to not revel in the moment as you take a deep breath of that fresh international air and exchange vows with me and the @elopementcollective in some epic location like Italy, Iceland, or anywhere in-between.</p> 
<p>I’m up for a European wedding adventure any day of the week, but in June and July 2024 I’ll be there with The Elopement Collective plus House of Lucie and Jason Corroto.</p> 
<p>More info available in my email my name at my last name dot co or <a href="https://withers.co/europe">withers.co/europe</a>.</p> 
<p>This is me with Stuart and Chelsea outside of some epic villa in Tuscany, Italy, with Jason Lucas a few years ago. Epic trip.</p>
