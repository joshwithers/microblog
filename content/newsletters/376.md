<p>I've upgraded my MacBook this week to a new MacBook Pro, and a friend asked me how it was.</p> 
<p>I said it's unnoticeable, like a good marriage celebrant, or a good real estate agent should be. That good that you don't notice.</p> 
<p>When your computer is slow you notice, and you moan about it. When your celebrant isn't confident and delivering a great ceremony, you notice it and joke about it at the reception, and when your real estate agent is a dodgy one, you really notice, and tell all your mates.</p> 
<p>My hope is that I'm that good that you don't notice. That I'd be like my new MacBook, so fast, efficient, and plain old good, that you don't notice how good until you think about all the other computers you've used and you realise you've got a real powerhouse of a computer in front of you.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/01/18/ive-upgraded-my.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-01-18</a></p> <hr> 
<p>I’m not antistacks, I’m just saying, when you’re on the bottom of a stacks-on it sucks. It’s all well and good if you’re on the top of the stack, but the rest of us have a large weight on our shoulders, torso, legs, etc.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/01/18/im-not-antistacks.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-01-18</a></p> <hr>

<p>A Jewish scholar I once heard speak talked about how his people viewed life and death not as one season followed by another, life and then death, but that throughout your day they were states you would enter. That your decisions and thoughts and actions would take into life or death.</p> 
<p>That for a people so obsessed with life after death and whether we could get into heaven - or if there was one at all - we could be focused on bringing heaven to earth today through our words, thoughts, and actions.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/01/21/a-jewish-scholar.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-01-21</a></p> <hr>

<p>I have issue with Apple’s Texas Hold’em game. Do they not have a graphic designer on staff? Could they not just get a photo of a bunch of Macs on a shelf in a garage from <a href="https://micro.blog/ismh">@ismh</a>?</p>

<p>I just want to get out ahead of any rumours being spread by our almost 11 month old and go on the record saying that we do feed her enough food, and some would say too much food.
