<p>Staff member of the 24/7 convenience store next to nightclubs in Fortitude Valley tells me that the clothes and footwear are how they make bank. The drinks and food are for the daytime crowd.</p>

<p>Whenever I hear people talk about the Christian/Catholic vote I always wonder why it has nothing to do with Matthew 25.</p> 
<p>I reckon if Jesus was a registered Australian voter today he’d probably vote the Greens first based on Matthew 25.</p>

<p>When I'm not marrying people, or shitposting on social, I write a weekly email for the southern end of the Gold Coast called The Tugun Pause. In <a href="Do%20you%20think%20a%20monorail%20would%20be%20better%20than%20light%20rail?%20https://www.tugunpause.com/p/its-a-bit-wet-innit?s=w">today's issue I wonder if a monorail would be better than the light rail everyone takes issue with</a>.</p>

<p>As an Australian who consumes far too much American content in the form of podcasts and emails, let me <a href="https://news.lettersofnote.com/p/please-dont-let-anyone-americanise">echo Douglas Adams</a>:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>"American audiences do not need to feel disturbed by the notion that places do exist outside the US"<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/05/12/as-an-australian.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-05-11</a></p> </blockquote> <hr> 
<p>Apple Photos’ memories feature can detect when I’m at a Foo Fighters concert but categorises the photos from the hospital at Southport where both our daughters first appear in the library as “Southport over the years”.</p>

<p>Talking to a celebrant friend this morning and they have a funeral this afternoon where there's only one family member attending because the deceased pissed off everyone she ever knew.</p> 
<p>The celebrant has a reading that's "good for people who pissed everyone off."<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/05/13/talking-to-a.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-05-12</a></p> <hr> 
<p>When a wedding vendor emails you prices and you don’t reply</p>

<p><strong>Rest In Peace, still images on Instagram</strong></p> 
<p>Ok, I’m a little bit sad because the Internet is changing and I don’t like it.</p> 
<p>My favourite thing to create outside of marriage ceremonies, are photos. Video is fine, but there’s something so beautifully finite about a photo.</p> 
<p>A photo says everything it wants to say and no more. You don’t need volume up, and you can give it as much attention as you like. You’re not forced to spend a certain amount of time on it. You can spend all day looking at and thinking about a still photo, or half a second.</p> 
<p>The medium requires nothing, but everything off you. You can just as easily swipe past it as much as it can change your life.</p> 
<p>High quality and colour graded is nice, but I think about the first computer I owned. The entire screen was 640 pixels wide, and 480 pixels high, and each pixel could be one of 256 colours. Nothing fancy, but I saw photos that changed me on that screen.</p> 
<p>So Instagram, Facebook, and Meta are pretty much moving away from still photos. Recent changes mean the entire company is deprioritising photos and prioritising Reels. Think about the last time you saw something on a Meta platform that wasn’t a moving picture.</p> 
<p>So if we want to stay in touch, it’s gotta be over video. Unless you’re on somewhere cool like Twitter, Glass, or Micro.Blog I guess.</p> 
<p>Video killed the photograph star.</p>

<p>One of the best things about the internet is how you are distincitly awards how few people are listening to you.</p> 
<p>For a decade I worked in an industry where we broadcast from soundproof rooms playing music and talking excitedly under the guise of everyone listening to us.</p> 
<p>Here on the internet we have verifiable proof that most people aren’t listening.</p> 
<p>So if you feel alone here, you’re not. But then you weirdly, kind of, really are.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/05/13/one-of-the.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-05-13</a></p> <hr>
