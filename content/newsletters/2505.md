<p>It’s not often you get Coolangatta and Surfers Paradise in the same photo. But that’s what happens when I’m back in Australia :)</p>

<p>Cute. On <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/19/science/time-leap-second-bipm.html">the news that the leap second is being removed</a>, Rev. Pavel Gabor, an astrophysicist and the vice director of the Vatican Observatory Research Group in Tucson, Arizona said that,</p> <blockquote> 
<p>"atomic timekeeping was just one example of how the world was becoming incomprehensible to the average person, and that scientists had a responsibility to help people feel in control of their lives."</p> </blockquote> 
<p>And he went on to say,</p> <blockquote> 
<p>“I think sensitivity to this mistrust of elites, mistrust of experts, mistrust of science and institutions, that’s something that’s a very real problem in today’s world,” he said. “And let’s not contribute to it.”</p> </blockquote> 
<p>I'm so looking forward to the world returning to normalcy and peace in 2035 when the leap second is removed.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/11/25/cute-on-the.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-11-24</a></p> <hr>

<p>The internet is more fun when you upload as much as you download. When you stop, comment, post, share instead of doom scroll. People create and also consume, not just consume consume consumer consume.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/11/25/the-internet-is.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-11-24</a></p> <hr>

<p>Couple I'm marrying tomorrow: We'd like to have an entertaining and funny wedding ceremony.
