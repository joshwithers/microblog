<p>I truly struggle to understand why we - as a global community - are so weird about immigration. That because of the genetic lottery you were born in a certain fenced area so you mainly just stay there for most of your life.</p> 
<p>And we all fight to maintain that level of normalcy.</p>

<p><strong>Got a new 24mm</strong></p> 
<p>I acquired a new lens for my Canon EOS R5 camera today, the new Canon RF 24mm f/1.8. I'm generally a fan of a long lens, like my favourite 70-200mm. If I had a pack horse with me (and endless money) I'd have the <a href="https://www.digidirect.com.au/canon-rf-600mm-f-4l-is-usm-lens">$20,000 600mm</a> on me at all times. But for family photos, portraits, some landscapes, and vlogging you need something a little wider.</p> 
<p>Britt loves a 35mm, me not so much. I've enjoyed my little 50mm, but it's not wide enough, in that it's not wide at all. I trialled the RF 16m but that's too warped and wide.</p> 
<p>When Canon announced the new RF 24mm I had three positive thoughts:</p> <ol> <li>The main camera on iPhones today is a 26mm equivalent, and the iPhone is where I fell in love with making photography</li> <li>With an R5 I can punch in with a 1.6x crop, which is a 38mm equivalent, so I can still get a tighter shot and although it's cropping the 44.8 megapixels from the sensor, there's still plenty to spare.</li> <li>My photo kit had gotten too big, particularly if we're travelling.</li> </ol> 
<p>So I sold my 16mm, 35mm, and I'm about to sell my 50mm, and I'll be left with this 24mm and my 70-200.</p> 
<p>How does the Canon RF 24mm compare to an iPhone 12 Pro 26mm? Here's two moments captured by both, and edited in Lightroom on the iPhone with my friend Bec's <a href="https://www.storykeeper.co/presets">Story Keeper presets</a>:</p>

<p>Has anyone tried letting their toddler just leave and run into the wild? Maybe us parents are the only things holding them back from glory? Maybe warm clothes, a sleep routine, dry nappies, and regular food really is the last thing they want?<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/09/13/has-anyone-tried.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-09-12</a></p> <hr>

<p>You know you‚Äôre at an Australian country pub when they don‚Äôt know what an IPA, or XPA, or pale ale is.

<p>Took the girls to the office today. I must‚Äôve married hundreds of people in the Blue Mountains over the past 14 years so it was weird to be there wrangling toddlers instead of bridal parties (basically the same thing tho).</p>

<p>Patagonia Founder Gives Away the Company to Fight Climate Change, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/14/climate/patagonia-climate-philanthropy-chouinard.html">writes David Gelles in The New York Times</a>:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>‚ÄúIn some ways, the forfeiture of Patagonia is not terribly surprising coming from Mr. Chouinard. As a pioneering rock climber in California‚Äôs Yosemite Valley in the 1960s, Mr. Chouinard lived out of his car and ate damaged cans of cat food that he bought for five cents apiece. Even today, he wears raggedy old clothes, drives a beat up Subaru and splits his time between modest homes in Ventura and Jackson, Wyo. Mr. Chouinard does not own a computer or a cellphone.‚Äù<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/09/17/patagonia-founder-gives.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-09-17</a></p> </blockquote> <hr>
