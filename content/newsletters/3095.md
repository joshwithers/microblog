<p>16 years ago today the way I viewed the world changed completely. I can still remember seeing that little lump of plastic and metal in Steve Jobs's hand, watching a video stream, and thinking that everything changed. Today that remains ever so.</p> 
<p>I believe that you can measure the meaning of something by imagining taking it away. What would life be like if we didn't have it? Like earlier today I mused to a friend that if a certain media property disappeared, no one would notice.</p> 
<p>Imagine a world without the iPhone. You might point to Android phones, but 16 years ago today <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/20/5229618/android-started-over-the-day-the-iphone-was-announced">the team developing Android 'started over'</a> and despite the common argument that iPhone copies Android's leadership, on that day, Android took iPhone's lead.</p> 
<p>Even comparing the two, Android was just a software platform under development. iPhone was hardware and software. Not long after it became a software development platform and the world as we know it today changed completely. Services you take for granted were enabled that day.</p> 
<p>16 years is nothing special, but every year when this date rolls around, and the subsequent anniversaries, I reflect how years later we've not experienced a tectonic shift like that since.</p> 
<p><a href="https://stevejobsarchive.com/internal-meeting-at-apple">"Make something wonderful and put it out there."</a> You sure did, Apple. You sure did.</p>

<p>You look at this photo and think it's some kind of grand cathedral in Rome. It's a storage room in Ravello.</p> 
<p>Every week, sometimes every day, Britt and my inbox is filled with couples worrying about what happens if it rains, or if it's too hot, or if something something. All valid worries, but they don't stress us out too much because we always find a way. We'll always find a storage room on the Amalfi Coast that also just happens to be an epic location for your ceremony.</p> 
<p>That's what we do. We look for solutions, not problems.</p> 
<p>Any chimp can find a problem. We find a storage room, move all the things being stored, and then walk you into a sacred place where you can exchange vows intimately, in private, with joy and peace.</p> 
<p>This is Raimie and Kelly on the <a href="https://withers.co/europe">Amalfi Coast</a> in Villa Cimbrone with <a href="https://withers.co/elopementcollective">the Elopement Collective</a> and Joey &amp; Jase.</p>

<p>My 2023 challenge is to get really good at modern search engine optimisation, which is pretty different to 2019's SEO. So I've got a new project using <a href="https://superstash.co">Superstash</a>, and it's a <a href="https://celebrant.xyz">celebrant directory</a>.

<p>Thirteen years ago I read this on Seth Godin‚Äôs blog and it‚Äôs sat with me every day since:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>‚ÄúOne option is to struggle to be heard whenever you're in the room ... another is to be the sort of person who is missed when you're not. The first involves making noise. The second involves making a difference.‚Äù</p> </blockquote> 
<p>All I want to in this life is make a difference. Nothing in me wants to make a noise.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/01/10/thirteen-years-ago.html" class="microblog_permalink">2023-01-10</a></p> <hr> 
<p><strong>Dataism, the newest religion on the block</strong></p> 
<p><a href="https://www.thebeliever.net/artificial-intelligence-god/?ref=refind">Meghan O‚ÄôGieblyn in The Believer posits that AI is a new god</a>, the god of Dataism.</p> <blockquote> 
<p>"Science was supposed to have banished God, but he keeps turning up in our latest technologies. He is the ghost lurking in our data sets, the cockroach hiding beneath the particle accelerator."</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Going on to this banger:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>‚ÄúJust as according to Christianity we humans cannot understand God and His plan, so Dataism declares that the human brain cannot fathom the new master algorithms.‚Äù<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/01/10/dataism-the-newest.html" class="microblog_permalink">2023-01-10</a></p> </blockquote> <hr>

<p>In every intellectual relationship there‚Äôs the person who recommends podcast episodes, and there‚Äôs the other person who doesn‚Äôt even listen to the recommended episodes.</p> 
<p>In my and Scott‚Äôs relationship, I‚Äôm the recommending party.</p> 
<p>But as is the fashion of the other person the two episodes of the one podcast that Scott recommended I listen this week, this is a banger.</p> 
<p>Hallelujah, an <a href="https://www.pushkin.fm/podcasts/revisionist-history/hallelujah">episode of Malcolm Gladwell‚Äôs Revisionist History</a>, is possibly one of the most thought provoking 30 minutes of my life.</p> 
<p>The single idea that at the point of release, the moment of deliverance, the second you ship this creative work, that it‚Äôs more than likely not done yet, terrifies me.</p> 
<p>We live a life today where I do a thing and it‚Äôs done and we move on.</p> 
<p>Contemplating that Leonard Cohen‚Äôs Hallelujah took the journey documented in this podcast, I‚Äôm going to sit with this for so long.</p> 
<p>Please listen to this, then message me and let me know what you thought.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/01/14/in-every-intellectual.html" class="microblog_permalink">2023-01-15</a></p> <hr>

<p>Steve Jobs on how asking for help is a superpower:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>"I've never found anybody that didn't want to help me if I asked them for help. I called up Bill Hewlett (founder of HP) when I was 12 years old. He answered the phone himself. I told him I wanted to build a frequency counter. I asked if he had any
spare parts I could have. He laughed. He gave me the parts. And he gave me a summer job at HP working on the assembly line putting together frequency counters. I have never found anyone who said no, or hung up the phone. I just ask. Most people never pick up the phone and call. And that is what separates the people who do things, versus the people who just dream about them. You have to act."<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/01/15/steve-jobs-on.html" class="microblog_permalink">2023-01-15</a></p> </blockquote> <hr>
