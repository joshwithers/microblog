<p><strong>A proposal: a social network owned by creators</strong></p> 
<p>Social networks have three assets: a network effect (so we can connect with people), content moderation (so we can actually enjoy using it), content (so we have something to enjoy/consume).</p> 
<p>The content creators have always been at the bottom of the stack. Underpaid and under-appreciated," by the social network owners.</p> 
<p>So what if we made a Twitter owned by us?</p> 
<p>There's a turning tide against Twitter and Meta towards Mastodon, and honestly Mastodon is pretty good. It's decentralised in that you can sign up to any Mastodon server/instance and talk to other people on other instances, that's called federation. It's one of the tentpole features of Mastodon. Federation, or the fediverse, means you can sign up to, for example, the <a href="http://mastodon.social">@mastodon.social</a> instance and if I'm in <a href="http://aus.social">@aus.social</a>, we can talk to each other.</p> 
<p>But if we're both on the same instance there's some nice ways of discovering other people and other content, in particular discovering people and content on the same server.</p> 
<p>Plus the instance you choose to be on has a brand story. If you're communicating how to find and follow you on Mastodon there's a branding aspect. Imagine saying on a podcast "follow me at Josh at Mastodon dot social" as opposed to "follow me at Josh at cool name dot com." It can't be long until corporations and large brands take the opportunity to start their own instance.</p> 
<p>So what if content creators got in early and had our own network?</p> 
<p>That's my proposal, to start a Mastodon instance owned and run by content creators. Podcasters, writers, newsletter writers, vloggers, video makers, photographers, personalities, broadcasters - creators. Because we'd own the network we'd reap the benefits, instead of sending them to VCs, corporations, or Elon Musk/Zuckerberg.</p> 
<p>Because all the creators have existing networks - and products - we'd flex our influence to bring audiences to the new network. Also, in case it's not obvious, nothing will be taken away from your existing work. What changes is that instead of providing Twitter and Meta with free content that upholds the network effect that feeds their shareholders/stakeholders, you're providing free content to build and uphold your own network that operates like a co-op content farmers market.</p> 
<p>I own the domain name 'theradio.au' and I reckon it'd be kind of cool to say 'follow me at Josh at theradio dot au' in a video or a link o my profile being <a href="https://theradio.au/@josh">theradio.au/@josh</a> ... or insert your content brand in place of Josh.</p> 
<p>I like the generic-ish name, and the idea of "I'm on the radio" as a term of phrase for using the social media platform, particularly as actually being on the FM/AM radio means so little.</p> 
<p>I'm open to listening to ideas around how to start, run, and do this well. There are costs to running a Mastdon instance and because the benefits run to creators I'd look to creators to fund the project. With enough people it might be $50-100 a year, and I see the incentives run in the right direction if creators fund and own it. Other business models lend themselves to other incentives and next minute you're owned by Elon Musk.</p> 
<p>Weigh in on the social platform of your choice or email me at josh@withers.co.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/11/14/a-proposal-a.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-11-14</a></p> <hr> 
<p>I’ll never forget today. The day that my 20 month old daughter, whilst holding a banana, screamed for another banana, but when she had two, realised she only wanted one.</p> 
<p>The classic B1 and B2 dilemma.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/11/14/ill-never-forget.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-11-15</a></p> <hr> 
<p>In the future we won’t share our most intimate stories with, and through, the world’s biggest tech companies. Mastodon and blogs might not be the complete indieweb story, but it’s at least in the first or second chapter.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/11/16/in-the-future.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-11-16</a></p> <hr> 
<p>Street names in Baja are wild, in that they barely exist. To prove my residence/address I need to show an electrical bill. So this street a few blocks from our house is hilariously named.</p> 
<p>It's named after a gardener who still lives in that street, and drinks multiple litres of alcohol a day. His nick name is "Litre" or in Spanish "Litro". So a gringo who loves him had a street sign made, attached to the pole at the start of the street, now everyone calls it Litro Street.</p>

<p>This is Noah Sushi in Pescadero. The best sushi I have ever tasted, and I've had good sushi, even in Japan. It's on a dirt road, with no signage, and no fancy tables inside. People come from hundreds of kilometres around to enjoy it.</p> 
<p>Baja is wild.</p>

<p>Britt &amp; I toured around this new resort, Rancho Pescadero, last week to talk about making weddings there. Those oceanview rooms are actually built into dunes &amp; the cactus were geotagged then replanted back into the same exact locations. Only $3k a night on the beach there!</p>

<p><strong>"You are all your work has"</strong></p> 
<p>Maeve Brennan in a letter to Tillie Olsen via Letters of Note:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>"I have been trying to think of the word to say to you that would never fail to lift you up when you are too tired or too sad not [to] be downcast. But I can think only of a reminder—you are all it has. You are all your work has. It has nobody else and never had anybody else. If you deny it hands and a voice, it will continue as it is, alive, but speechless and without hands. You know it has eyes and can see you, and you know how hopefully it watches you. But I am speaking of a soul that is timid but that longs to be known. When you are so sad that you ‘cannot work’ there is always a danger fear will enter in and begin withering around. A good way to remain on guard is to go to the window and watch the birds for an hour or two or three. It is very comforting to see their beaks opening and shutting."<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2022/11/17/you-are-all.html" class="microblog_permalink">2022-11-17</a></p> </blockquote> <hr>

<p>Sharing <a href="https://news.lettersofnote.com/p/gods-law">God's Law</a> from Letters of Note, as seen multiple times around the internet and on The West Wing, now in it's original form, by Kent Ashcraft:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>Dear Dr. Laura,</p> 
<p>Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God’s law. I have learned a great deal from you, and I try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend homosexuality, for example, I will simply remind him or her that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination. End of debate.</p> 
<p>I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some of the other laws in Leviticus and Exodus and how to best follow them.</p> 
<p>When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord (Leviticus 1:9). The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. How should I deal with this?</p> 
<p>I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as stated in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?</p> 
<p>I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanliness (Leviticus 15:19-24). The problem is, how can I tell? </p> 
<p>I have tried asking, but most women take offense.
Leviticus 25:44 states that I may buy slaves from the nations that are around us. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify?</p> 
<p>I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself?</p> 
<p>A friend of mine says that even though eating shellfish is an abomination (Leviticus 10:10), it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don’t agree. Can you settle this?</p> 
<p>Leviticus 20:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here?</p> 
<p>I know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident you can help. Thank you again for reminding us that God’s Word is eternal and unchanging.</p>
