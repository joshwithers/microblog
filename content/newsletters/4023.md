<p><strong>My “Batman only exists because of 9/11” theory</strong></p> 
<p>I have a theory: today in 2023, we have a Batman because terrorists flew airplanes into the World Trade Centre towers in New York City, a.k.a Gotham City.</p> 
<p>My premise is that timing of My Chemical  Romance’s Welcome To The Black Parade’s release influenced Robert Pattison’s Batman at an influential age and made him the Bruce Wayne portrayed in the 2022 film, The Batman.</p> 
<p>The 2022 Batman was born in 1991 or 1992, making him “<a href="https://screenrant.com/the-batman-how-old-is-robert-pattinsons-bruce-wayne/">about 30</a>” when the movie was released.</p> 
<p><a href="https://screenrant.com/the-batman-wayne-parents-murder-killer-identity-explained/">The Batman’s parents died in 2001</a> (possibly 2002), the year that terrorists flew into the World Trade Towers and changed the world forever. One such change being that <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Chemical_Romance#History">Gerard Way formed the band My Chemical Romance</a> in response to the attacks. The other obvious infliction point here is that the death of Thomas and Martha Wayne is the motivation for young Bruce to become Vengeance personified.</p> 
<p>In 2006 when The Batman was about 15 or 16 ‘<a href="https://youtu.be/RRKJiM9Njr8">Welcome To The Black Parade</a>’ was released. Bruce is still rattled by his parent’s murders, growing up a young boy trying to figure out who he is and what his purpose is.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/12/17003076/spotify-data-shows-songs-teens-adult-taste-music">Your teenage years and the music you listen to through those years are formative</a> to who you are and the music you love.</p> 
<p>Look at some of My Chemical Romance’s lyrics from the Black Parade:</p> <blockquote> 
<p>When I was a young boy,
My father took me into the city,
To see a marching band.
He said, "Son, when you grow up,
Would you be the savior of the broken,
The beaten and the damned?"
He said, "Will you defeat them?
Your demons, and all the non-believers,
The plans that they have made?"
"Because one day, I'll leave you a phantom...</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Cut to 2022 in film, The Batman</p> <blockquote> 
<p>“They think I am hiding in the shadows, but I am the shadows.”</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Bruce Wayne is the Batman we know in 2022 because of 9/11.</p>

<p>I was moved to hear of Father Bob's passing. I've never met or talked to a crankier, lovelier, old bloke who was thoroughly and passionately focused on loving and caring for humans without personal gain or agenda.</p> 
<p>When I think about being Christ-like, I think of Bob.</p> 
<p>Many publicly-known priests and ministers are loved by church leadership whilst being in the news for scandal and crime, while Bob was hated by church leadership whilst in the news for loving the outcasts of society.</p> 
<p>I'd rather die a man lambasted by church leaders and known as a friend to outcasts, the downtrodden, the forgotten, the least of our society. That's who Bob was.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/04/18/i-was-moved.html" class="microblog_permalink">2023-04-19</a></p> <hr> 
<p>I'm working on a new business that is a web service - a mobile/desktop web app with video and audio upload components + email. I've never directly hired devs for this kind of project before. What kind of web dev language and tech should I be asking for in 2023?<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/04/19/im-working-on.html" class="microblog_permalink">2023-04-19</a></p> <hr> 
<p><strong>My first tweet was tweeted 18 months before I even started tweeting</strong></p> 
<p>I've been reminiscing over Twitter this week, wondering <a href="https://twitter.com/JoshuaWithers/status/1604356662042705920?s=20">what the last tweet will be</a> amongst other things as Space Karen <a href="https://twitter.com/verified/status/1648764138452299778">prepares to take away the verification tick on my profile</a> that proves I am who I am, a tick gifted to me from my time in the media in Australia. </p>

<p>I started my <a href="https://twitter.com/joshuawithers">current Twitter account in October 2009</a> but I was sure that I had an account before then so I went searching and searching and searching and found it: <a href="https://twitter.com/1073brekky">March 2008, @1073brekky</a>.</p> 
<p><img src="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2023/09ff5444ac.png" width="600" height="174" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p> 
<p>In 2008 I scored my first paid breakfast radio gig: the morning show on 107.3 FM on the Gold Coast (at the time called 1073fm but now called Juice FM). I'd been training and prepping for this role for five years and was so keen. I was also a bread-and-butter kind of computer nerd, so ideally my non-nerdy radio show would have some nerdy elements. In 2008 the breakfast guy didn't get access to the website - they probably still don't today - so I wanted to find a way to post short updates to the website. Something inside of me felt like the internet might be a thing one day so it would be good to use it early. I've got so many stories about being the nerdiest and most future-thinking guy in the radio station that it broke my heart so many times to be honest.</p> 
<p>I had heard things about this service in the USA called Twitter that had heralded a new kind of web publishing, micro-blogging. You could send updates to the service and they could appear in a website widget. I <a href="https://twitter.com/1073brekky">signed up</a>, got the code to the web developer and before you know it, I could post updates to my show website! I didn't care so much for the Tweeting, the replying, or the broadcasting. I just wanted to blog on my radio station website and the CRM didn't allow blogging or micro-blogging or anything of the like.</p> 
<p>Twitter solved my problem and I'm sure my problem was never in any of their minimum-viable product meetings. </p>

<p>About two months later I quit the station because at the time it was honestly a terrible place a human with a soul could want to work, but fifteen years on I only have good memories from my first breakfast show, my first Twitter account, and my experiences being unleashed on the Gold Coast community on the radio.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/04/19/my-first-tweet.html" class="microblog_permalink">2023-04-20</a></p> <hr>

<p>I need help with panoramic images made with my DJI Mavic 3 drone. The camera itself stitches the images together but the stitch is never great. So it saves the 25 individual images, but Photoshop and Lightroom can never deal with them well. What software can help with this?</p>

<p>I’ve been saying crap on the internet and into microphones connected to radio and TV towers for 20 years next year, it’s a miracle that the most scandalous thing I’ve done is MAFS series one.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/04/20/ive-been-saying.html" class="microblog_permalink">2023-04-21</a></p> <hr> 
<p>The saddest part about Elon Musk screwing up Twitter and Twitter Blue is that the Internet needs to install a values system where we understand things have a cost and Twitter shouldn’t be free.</p> 
<p>But now paying $8 for Twitter is a meme, not an exercise in human betterment.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/04/23/the-saddest-part.html" class="microblog_permalink">2023-04-24</a></p> <hr>
