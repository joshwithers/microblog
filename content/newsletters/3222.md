<p>It might be 8yrs late, but you're finally getting my book: The Rebel's Guide To Getting Married is coming in 2023. It's a book about planning a wedding with intention and purpose, written by yours truly, Oz's most hated celebrant &amp; I'm writing live on my <a href="https://rebels.guide">wedding blog</a>.</p>

<p><strong>One Million Downloads on Unsplash</strong></p> 
<p>Ive always secretly thought that when I reached 1 million downloads on Unsplash I’d stop posting there.</p> 
<p>But as I passed the landmark this week I realised that sometimes we set silly goals about silly things.</p> 
<p>I still don’t know why I share my art there, but I know I get more messages, emails, and commissioned paid work from Unsplash than I do from any other of my networks or communities.</p>

<p>Luna just asked Britt, “will you ever kill me, mummy?” And honestly, at the age of four it’s impressive that she’s already assembling friends and enemies lists, and that I got an auto-invite to the friends list but her mother required some investigation first.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/01/29/luna-just-asked.html" class="microblog_permalink">2023-01-30</a></p> <hr> 
<p>Do you know the most disappointing thing about the United States of America?</p> 
<p>That the entire narrative of and about the country is defined by a small handful of topics recycled so quickly that outsiders often don't even know which Police Officer killing, which mass shooting, which disappointing President, or which sexually abusive old white male you're all angry about this week. It's hard to keep up, and you need new stories. Not new fake stories so the rest of the world thinks you're cool again. You need new truths so the new stories just kinda flow pretty easily.</p> 
<p>Or be like Iceland. No-one ever hears about Iceland unless it's a photo of some cool landscape.<br> <a href="https://joshwithers.blog/2023/01/29/do-you-know.html" class="microblog_permalink">2023-01-30</a></p> </div>
